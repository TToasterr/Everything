"Today's (2003) video editing computers often have 1GB of RAM or more, but 256 MB is often sufficient"
I read that and got really confused because I hadnt seen the date


JONKKKK#4186
hah


WillCo Gaming#0258
oof.
1 gig of RAM!?
You can't run linux on that, let alone windos and vid software.
CORRECTION:  You can run really lightweigh piecofshist distros, but not real linux.

WillCo Gaming#0258
YOU DONT NEED THE ADMIN PASS TO CHANGE THE VOLUME

WillCo Gaming#0258
Mine has passwords on all four accounts.


Sintayman707#4085

BLARG


WillCo Gaming#0258
Who set up the comp?


Sintayman707#4085

WillCo Gaming#0258

WillCo Gaming#0258
When he gets home, get him to password.'


Sintayman707#4085

WillCo Gaming#0258
Also, this is why I have a personal comp.


Sintayman707#4085

my mom wont get me one
dont ask why
or let me get one


WillCo Gaming#0258

Sintayman707#4085
üòê


WillCo Gaming#0258

efish#0382
I would also like to protest the lack of diversity in the planning and attendance of this server.  I would like to be able to address prejudice on this server and servers like it.
Micro-aggressions made by privileged white males in previous comments offend me, and I suggest they be kicked from this server.


Philio Io#6139
I second this motion
This whole server experience has left me disgusted and I've had enough
I want to see some action taking place because it's 2018 and it's not okay to attack other people for any reason
Also, Hitler did nothing wrong


GoldenPot8o#2294

Zildin#0532
No he‚Äôs not


Sintayman707#4085

GoldenPot8o#2294

GoldenPot8o#2294

Sintayman707#4085

Philio Io#6139
in my experience, running a country that you want to live in is not very beneficial


GoldenPot8o#2294
*well neither is* ***my*** *utopia so*
because my utopia is a premise of a video game and that means that its probably not the best
?

GoldenPot8o#2294
looks like *somebodys* country sucks


WillCo Gaming#0258
yeet
Also, congrats on being elected WA delegate.


GoldenPot8o#2294
thanks
yeet, i think that was a good choice


WillCo Gaming#0258
Nice.
*Leader's power is effectively nullified as no bill becomes law without the upper house's support, prohibition has allowed a Maxtopian immigrant known only as "Nipples" to establish an illicit breast milk syndicate, a popular saying is "a chicken for every pot and an abortion clinic on every street", and criminals always seem to be forewarned of police raids.*


GoldenPot8o#2294
damn your country sounds succy


WillCo Gaming#0258
somewhat
the economy's not what it could be
But at least the environment's good, and there's no crime

Long, healthy lives.
It ain't perfect, but it's home.


GoldenPot8o#2294
1 or 3 would have lowered civil rights


WillCo Gaming#0258
yeah


Toaster#2600
Fun fact: nate isn't leader by default


Philio Io#6139
lmao


Toaster#2600
Fun fact #2: polls go in the poll channel @GoldenPot8o#2294 and also don't @ everyone you tard I just got back from dealing with jonathab for three days and now I feel like demoting you congrats


Philio Io#6139
jonathab
nice


Toaster#2600
I'm on a phone what do you expect


GoldenPot8o#2294
i think everyone knew it was a *joke*


Toaster#2600
What


Philio Io#6139
how many notifications did you get toaster


GoldenPot8o#2294
also i forgot we had a polls


Toaster#2600
First of all: what was a joke, nothing there was a joke
Second of all: you're an admin, and I'm p sure you're the one who requested the polls too, stop being a rart


Philio Io#6139
oofed


GoldenPot8o#2294
im a rart i know thats why i forgot we had a polls, also the whole "leader by default" thing was a joke


Philio Io#6139
oofed


Toaster#2600
Yeah I know I was just saying it was a gay joke


Philio Io#6139
OOFED


Toaster#2600
I should get some decent admins so I can actually leave for a couple days and not have the server go to shit lol


WillCo Gaming#0258
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø


Philio Io#6139
or you shouldn't invite people who will spam constantly


Toaster#2600
You send "oof" between every message Phillip I don't think you can talk lol


Philio Io#6139
exactly my point


WillCo Gaming#0258
this is funny


Toaster#2600
*lemme just kick Phillip real quick*
Nah lmao


GoldenPot8o#2294
i think the issue is that those dont exist, you dont want really anyone on the server running the server, jonk no, me no, liam no, literally anybody


Toaster#2600
Liam might be okay but he's never on
Jonathan's good but he was gone with me
You're obviously not good, as proven by the last three days


WillCo Gaming#0258
i don't really care
i'm too tired


Toaster#2600
If I went through ppl on this server there are plenty of good admins
Honestly might make will an admin
Congrats you win
Mmmm actually get to trusted first then you can be an amdin


Philio Io#6139
wow no i get it


WillCo Gaming#0258

As a representative of the tall people, I can assure you that we will direct our actions to your heads, which are located at roughly waist height.


Toaster#2600
As a representative of the taller than average but still not extremely tall but taller than short people, I can assure you that we will take action at either:
-The shoulders or neck of tall people
-Still the head of short people because they're short lol


WillCo Gaming#0258
The tall people acknowledge that.


efish#0382
As a representative of the 99th percantile, I assure you that you will be kicked in the head, located roughly at knee height

this is a good thing


Toaster#2600
piemations' patreon is the best thing







Toaster#2600
im in a CSGO match with flipgod lmao
so far we're somehow winning so thats cool
I have a KDR of 1
in a game against flipgod id say thats p good lol


Nikdane12#3216
should i get this one?


Philio Io#6139
what is the point of getting a special "gaming" mouse


Toaster#2600
looks decent for the price but its ptobably not that good


Nikdane12#3216
its better


Toaster#2600
again considering the price
if you;re gonna get a mouse like that get a good one like corsair or something
if I ever get a scimtar ill give you my current one lol


Philio Io#6139
wow, i need to pay $15 so that i can click better


Nikdane12#3216
i know and how bout this one?


Toaster#2600
that ones probably better but i mean honestly why do you even want a mouse like that
just to look cool?


Philio Io#6139
exactly


Toaster#2600
I have a mouse sorta like that and im saving up for one with 15 something hotkeys but Idrc about looking cool, I need the macros


Nikdane12#3216
bc i used a good mouse at the teen center and i was alot better


Toaster#2600
then just get a good normal mouse


Nikdane12#3216
then where to get one


Toaster#2600
its cheaper and probably higher quality


Philio Io#6139
its kinda the same with keyboards, if you use a mechanical keyboard, you can type much better, but it doesn't make sense to spend that much money, or any money really, for a slight performance increase


Toaster#2600
again on that though phillip, I have my sooper coolio keyboard cuz it has hotkeys üòâ
also @Nikdane12#3216
thats the one I have
not too expensive and just normal
this is the one I WANT
corsair stuff is all pretty good, except the headset mics from my experience


Toaster#2600
how do you get 11 million followers


Philio Io#6139
record a dead body


Toaster#2600

Toaster#2600
its just space for the subtitties and logo
plus its a nice gradient


GoldenPot8o#2294
just like


Toaster#2600
it really just started with the bloons video because bloons is smol and I had to crop it down no matter what because scaling it up makes it look all pixely and bad
and then I just did it with the other one too


GoldenPot8o#2294
dont do the thing at the top that shows the game
and scale up the window a little after that


Toaster#2600
what
scale up what window
also i like the logos


GoldenPot8o#2294
get rid of this and make the video part larger


Toaster#2600
cant scale up the video
and no the logo is nice
with the duck game video I just like it because its not super intrusive its just a smol border
i can see how its annoying with the bloons video but i had to put something in the background lol

Speguni#3116
YouTube is never going to die


GoldenPot8o#2294
but it can still be ***O O F***


Speguni#3116
True


GoldenPot8o#2294
it should be exponential


Toaster#2600



GoldenPot8o#2294
because if a tuber leaves, their tuber friends will too, and so on


Speguni#3116
Toaster I honestly didn't even know it was you

Toaster#2600
sorry alex

Alexander#2606
can you try josh? i bet his is higher


Toaster#2600
close
94%


Alexander#2606
damn
i guess im just ugly then



Toaster#2600
i dunno how much higher than 98% you can get lol


Alexander#2606
i wonder if you can find someone at 100%


Toaster#2600
yeah lol
aww
"Disclaimer: It's not possible to get a hundred per cent probabilty"


Alexander#2606
oh wow. 99%?


Toaster#2600
99 thou
yeah


Alexander#2606
99.99999999%?
I am really the best at no one loving me
im so proud
where even are you getting these percentages?


Toaster#2600
guys
its all a conspiracy


WillCo Gaming#0258
I'm going to a movie soon, so I can't.


Alexander#2606
will what movie?


WillCo Gaming#0258
The Incredibles II


Toaster#2600


Alexander#2606
tell me if its good after you see it. I was thinking about seeing it for the nostalgia
blasphemy. that should 100%


WillCo Gaming#0258
no


Toaster#2600
alex it says youll love the incredibles two


WillCo Gaming#0258
you gotta account for the people who dont like freedom


Alexander#2606
ooh. exciting


Toaster#2600
OH
I got a 0%


WillCo Gaming#0258
what cmmnd is that @Toaster#2600


Toaster#2600
I typed in two underscores


Alexander#2606
guys i looked up merica and its actually in the dictionary


Toaster#2600


Alexander#2606



Toaster#2600
any two symbols just gives 0%


Alexander#2606
are you not seeing this


Toaster#2600
yeah numbers and symbols give 0%
also thats great lol


Alexander#2606
its in the dictionary
the actual dictionary
i love english


WillCo Gaming#0258
wait, what command?


Toaster#2600
what


WillCo Gaming#0258
what's giving you the percentages?
can I get a link or something?


Toaster#2600


WillCo Gaming#0258


Alexander#2606
i wonder where they get the percentages from


WillCo Gaming#0258
rand generator


Alexander#2606
is it just random or is there something to it?


Toaster#2600
no i dont think its random


WillCo Gaming#0258
rand generators are shockingly accurate for some reason


Toaster#2600
cuz if you plug in the same names twice in a row or whatever you get the same percents


Alexander#2606
maybe its like the number of characters in a name


Toaster#2600
well okay
i did what will did but put only 2 'o's in the cooked bread and got 67%
he got 65% with three o's


WillCo Gaming#0258
I suspect it uses the names to seed the generators


Toaster#2600
yeah


WillCo Gaming#0258
treat the names as numbers, and use the numbers as the starting point for a complicated equation


Toaster#2600
mhm
i did something sorta like that but


Alexander#2606
if you give me a time for the teens center i might be able to come. I just have t sign those papers
*to


Toaster#2600

I have custom command aliases in the linux command line, but I haven't used it in so long
one moment
# My aliases
alias xit='exit'
alias clr='clear'
alias nfetch='neofetch'
alias lnx='lynx'
alias quit='exit'
alias ?='help'
alias hell='help'


Toaster#2600
quality


WillCo Gaming#0258
this is in wsl
in real linux i have even more
I like 'xit' because it uses less chars, and is fun to type
(pronounced 'exit')


Toaster#2600
i feel like id pronounce that more 'cksit' but i get how its exit lol
x-ray is actually just 'cks-ray'


WillCo Gaming#0258
yeah, I'll read it as 'ksit', but that works too, and really, it's unimportant how I read computer terms, because it's spelling that matters.


Toaster#2600
my aliases are slightly more complicated than that lol


LoserLeague#6148
"**ABSOLUTELY YES** and **AUSCHWITZ WAS FINE** are typing..."


WillCo Gaming#0258
aaaaaaaa


LoserLeague#6148
Quality


WillCo Gaming#0258
ABSOLUTELY YES


Toaster#2600
instead of "xit = exit" mine are "+spoops = bind kp_ins +kickbot; bind kp_end +cheaty; bind kp_downarrow +longrounds; bind kp_pgdn +nothing; bind kp_leftarrow +surfrestart"


WillCo Gaming#0258
that;'s my catchphrase now

GoldenPot8o#2294
ah yes


Toaster#2600
or I guess 'logo'
either one


Nikdane12#3216
Uhhh


WillCo Gaming#0258
I didn't make mine.  It's just a nice wallpaper that doesn't fit my screen but makes a nice profile pic.


Toaster#2600
yeah but its more annoying with xavier because he uses it as like his logo
for literally everything


WillCo Gaming#0258
yah


Toaster#2600
and all he did was make a bad 'circle' and put a purple C in it


WillCo Gaming#0258
I have a logo.  This isn't my logo.


Toaster#2600
that is literally all he did to edit it


WillCo Gaming#0258
And my logo needs work.  It's messy.  I oughta try using Powerpoint or something.


Toaster#2600
also xavier what the fuck is your geometry dash page
its literally just a list of sprites
some of them arent even from GD
also you didnt even make that Minecraft skin you market either lol

Zildin#0532
Hey I‚Äôm in Denver but they did a fuck
Basically we had a small window to go through customs and recheck our bags before going to the gate. The baggage claim with our stuff stopped when we had one piece of luggage left. So instead of a 3:25 flight that could make us be at home at im  guessing (with a 1 hour flight) around 6pm we‚Äôre most likely taking a 7:17 flight with a home arrival at 10.


WillCo Gaming#0258
oof


Zildin#0532
Yep
So like fuk


WillCo Gaming#0258
Ah, airports.

Zildin#0532
Oh I forgot but I bought a sword in germany


Philio Io#6139
remind me how much of a fucking weeb you are?


Zildin#0532
What


Toaster#2600
yeah


Philio Io#6139
WHY WOULD YOU BUY A SWORD


Toaster#2600
p much


Zildin#0532
Cuz
It‚Äôs cool


Philio Io#6139
that's so pointless


Zildin#0532
Whybnot
It‚Äôs something neat to have


Philio Io#6139
what are trying to do, flex?


Zildin#0532
What
Explain


Philio Io#6139
you bought something because it costs money and not because it's practical in anyway
you will never use it


WillCo Gaming#0258
Swords come in handy at times.


Zildin#0532
It‚Äôs something neat to gave


Toaster#2600
so we have 2 weebs here
officially


Philio Io#6139
when will it come in handy?


Zildin#0532
Stabbing
If your getting robbed


Philio Io#6139
THAT IS NOT AN ANSWER
WTF


Toaster#2600
also you're


Zildin#0532
Idc


WillCo Gaming#0258
Actually, it is an answer.  Not a great one, but it is.
Swords are also useful for cutting things.


Philio Io#6139
YOU ThINK THAT WHEN SOMEONE IS ROBBING YOU THEY"RE GOING TO SEE YOUR SWORD AND BE LIKE "OH MAN, THIS GUY IS FOR REAL"


Zildin#0532
It‚Äôs not sharp so you can‚Äôt murder anyone, but you can just hit them in the nuts real hard


WillCo Gaming#0258
It doesn't need to be sharp.


Philio Io#6139
are you kidding


Zildin#0532
What


Philio Io#6139
you got a sword that isn't sharp


WillCo Gaming#0258
But using a dull blade on somebody is just mean.


Zildin#0532
Well why would it need to be sharp


WillCo Gaming#0258
SO YOU CAN USE IT


Philio Io#6139
why not just go to the scrap shop and duct tape a piece of metal to a smaller piece of wood?


WillCo Gaming#0258
also, dull blades make rough cuts
If you're going to use a sword, use a sharp one.


Philio Io#6139
yeah
that's like getting a gun that can't actually shoot straight


WillCo Gaming#0258
Pretty much.\
If you're going to get something, git gud.


Philio Io#6139
*git gud


Speguni#3116
Look at this bullshit


Philio Io#6139

it is still a bot so do it in #bot-commands


WillCo Gaming#0258
okee


Toaster#2600
hey @WillCo Gaming#0258 is there an easy way in JS to have chances to do things
like
90% of the time if I do -ping itll return 'pong' but the other 10% of the time itll do something else


WillCo Gaming#0258
I think...


Toaster#2600
the only thing i can think of is setting a variable to a random number and then if that variable is below 80 or whatever then send pong


WillCo Gaming#0258
yeah


Toaster#2600
ok


WillCo Gaming#0258
do an ifthen statement


Toaster#2600

Toaster#2600

if they feel like being active again they can rejoin


WillCo Gaming#0258
It's 7:16 on 7/16!  Yeet.


Toaster#2600

WillCo Gaming#0258
I noticed that just in time.
Hey, Toaster, do you do NationStates?


Toaster#2600
yeah a little


WillCo Gaming#0258
What's your country?


Toaster#2600
The Interuniversal Toaster Federation


WillCo Gaming#0258
Neato.  I'm Alterae.
This morning I legalized gay marriage and polygamy, and abolished standardized testing.  Things are great in Alterae.


Toaster#2600
I banned cars and I just also banned a sexual fetish


WillCo Gaming#0258
Oof.
Why the computer license?


Toaster#2600
oh yeahh
that one was dumb, there was no good answer for it


WillCo Gaming#0258
What were the options?


Toaster#2600
it was either ban computers, release unstable government AI, or have a computer liscense


WillCo Gaming#0258
ah


Toaster#2600
that issue was sorta dumb


WillCo Gaming#0258
I'd have gone for the AI.
I'm still waiting on the issue that'll get me nukes and a space program.
Also, I somehow managed to abolish prisons and still have practically no crime.
How that happened, I can't say.

Oren_BrickBoy#3376

Zildin#0532
He didn‚Äôt kick you tho


Toaster#2600
also yeah i did lol


Zildin#0532
Ph
I thought you had auto prune on


Toaster#2600
nope


Zildin#0532
Ok


Oren_BrickBoy#3376
so i wont get kicked


Toaster#2600
the thing with that is it only does it for people who dont have a role and since you get a role on joining it never prunes anyone
also no you wont


Toaster#2600
I sorta feel like making a CSGO map any ideas
maybe


Philio Io#6139
make a csgo map in the shape of a hammer and sickle


Toaster#2600
lmao
thatd just be weird tho lol
but actually I do sorta want to make another 1v1 map or something
just something easy but time consuming
i need something to do lol


Zildin#0532
Make one in the shape of a toaster with toast popping out.
Toaster
Do it


Toaster#2600
im not asking for a SHAPE of a map lol


Philio Io#6139
make a 5v5 map in the shape of a hammer and sickle


Zildin#0532
Oh


Toaster#2600
im asking for the general idea of a map
theme/type


Zildin#0532
Toast


Philio Io#6139
communism is the theme


Zildin#0532
That‚Äôs the theme
Toast


Toaster#2600
if you give me a theme I could make a 1v1 map that has obstacles with that theme
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN
I mean like


Zildin#0532
I know


Toaster#2600
city


Zildin#0532
Toast themed


Toaster#2600
half high half lower


Zildin#0532
I‚Äôm being serious


Toaster#2600
mostly flat
mirrored


Philio Io#6139
hammer and sickle shaped


Toaster#2600
that doesnt help me
okay im not asking you for ideas anymore lol


Philio Io#6139
do a half high half lower map with the high half shaped like a hammer and be yellow while the bottom half is red and shaped like a sickle


Toaster#2600
okay that would be kinda funny
but I still do think that a hammer/sickle shaped map wouldnt work very well


Philio Io#6139
ugh


Toaster#2600
I guess as a 1v1v1v1 it would work


Philio Io#6139
its FIINE


Toaster#2600
lol
i saw it in bot logs
you should buy the bypass


Philio Io#6139
eh


Zildin#0532
Q
Z


Toaster#2600

Toaster#2600

I do that fairly regularly.  It's good for your health.

You're a few hours off.

WillCo Gaming#0258
But there's so much more you could be doing.  Like eating lunch...

Speak of the Devil, look at the time!
You know what, I'm going to go take my own advice and locate some food.


Philio Io#6139

Nikdane12#3216
When


WillCo Gaming#0258
I spent yesterday out of town, in one hundred degree weather.
But it wasn't all bad.
My mom bought a new truck.


Philio Io#6139
Trucks are bad, and you should feel bad


Toaster#2600
wow people are actually online for once neat
but you know what im kinda tempted to do
it might not really work but still,


GoldenPot8o#2294
shut your up ok, nobody needs to hear the speak


Philio Io#6139
I agree


GoldenPot8o#2294
nah jk


Toaster#2600
Im sorta tempted to make it so that you earn interest on CASH instead of whats in your bank, so people will have cash instead of just depositing everything and ,rob will actually be useful


Philio Io#6139
Do it
Otherwise its so boring


Toaster#2600
not rn im too lazy


GoldenPot8o#2294
im sorta tempted to remove the fucking bot because it gave me 50 pings in 2 days


Philio Io#6139
Lol


Toaster#2600
what
it doesnt ping you anymore lol you dumbass


Philio Io#6139
NO CURSING


Toaster#2600
but what we could do is just say that you arent allowed to have more than half your money in the bank at any given time, and if you have more then your currency gets reset


Philio Io#6139
thats intense


Toaster#2600
spooky intense


Philio Io#6139
spoopy intnesnse


Toaster#2600
sporks in tent


Philio Io#6139
Dude
Thats not very appropriate


Toaster#2600
youre not very appropriate
xd gotem


Philio Io#6139
Oh
Ok


WillCo Gaming#0258
@Philio Io#6139 A truck is necessary for a lot of stuff my family does.  And it gets better gas mileage than the last one.  I mean:
2017 Ford Expedition
vs
1999 GMC Suburban

Which do you think is better?


Philio Io#6139
A tesla model s


Toaster#2600
lambo


WillCo Gaming#0258
ew
Sports cars have like no room in the back.
Fricking useless.
A Tesla would be good for getting groceries, but we have a car that does that already.
And also, neither a Tesla nor any kind of sports car is capable of towing a trailer.
Or carrying kayaks, or large furniture.


Philio Io#6139
If you want to do that, then you‚Äôre a nurd


WillCo Gaming#0258
Actually, that's like the opposite of being a nerd.


Philio Io#6139
Not really


WillCo Gaming#0258
Also, really, sports cars suck.


Philio Io#6139
How?


Toaster#2600
how often does the average family need to carry kayaks or large furniture
id much rather have a sports car than a truck


Philio Io#6139
Same


Toaster#2600
also i bet you could tow a trailer with a sports car


Philio Io#6139
Honestly, I don‚Äôt think so, but I would still prefer a sports car


Toaster#2600
really?
It might not work as well as with a normal car but itd still work


Philio Io#6139
Sports cars are really low to the ground, so it would be hard to attach it


WillCo Gaming#0258
You can't fit people in the back.
You can't carry much in the back.
It's ridiculously overpowered for commuting.
Also, you can NOT tow a trailer with a sports car.
The frame's all wrong, and there's now spot for a hitch.
And my family's not average.
We do need to carry large things in our vehicles on occasion.


Toaster#2600
if you can afford a sports car, why are you carrying people or anything else in the back of your car
and why would you be towing a trailer


WillCo Gaming#0258
Also, my mom's job involves a lot of driving on bad roads.


Philio Io#6139
See, will, you‚Äôve been spoiled your whole life with having a ton of space in your cars


Toaster#2600
hah


WillCo Gaming#0258
Well, it's a family vehichle.  Of course we have stuff in the back.


Toaster#2600
honestly i think the best option is just to be deadmau5


WillCo Gaming#0258
That's why we're carrying stuff in the back.
Also, an SUV is far cheaper than a sports car.


Toaster#2600
cheaper = not as good
haha gotcha there xd


WillCo Gaming#0258
False.


Philio Io#6139
You need to understand what its like to fit the entire family plus all of your luggage and backpacks and etc. into a car that is half the size of a truck


Toaster#2600
i was jokinnnnggggg


WillCo Gaming#0258
Dude, give me one practical reason to own a sports car.


Toaster#2600
its just a jessstttttt


Philio Io#6139
Looking cool


Toaster#2600
why not
you can drive places
thats a pretty useful thing


WillCo Gaming#0258
Because, unless you race, it's a fucking waste of money.
You can buy a solid car for a fraction of the price.


Toaster#2600
i think youre just jealous that we're gonna have cooler cars than you


WillCo Gaming#0258
Nah man.  I'd personally pick a Tesla.
But it isn't my car.
It's my mom's.


GoldenPot8o#2294
i ship it


Philio Io#6139
They are also pretty fuel efficient, if its a tesla you're talking about


WillCo Gaming#0258
WELL NO DUH


Philio Io#6139
considering how they dont use fuel...


WillCo Gaming#0258
They don'


Toaster#2600
hah


WillCo Gaming#0258
üëèüèº


Philio Io#6139
and yet trucks are "cheaper" but you need to use more expensive fuel, and a lot of it


WillCo Gaming#0258
No.


Toaster#2600
hey anyone feel like playing stuff


Philio Io#6139
no


WillCo Gaming#0258
You just need gasoline.


Toaster#2600
hey anyone other than phillip feel like playing stuff


Philio Io#6139
no


WillCo Gaming#0258
maybe


Toaster#2600
I feel like streaming stuff again
plus i want to talk with ppl and drink oj


Philio Io#6139
i can play at like 6


WillCo Gaming#0258
that's like dinner time


Toaster#2600
because if you arent doing that in the morning then really what are you doing with your life


WillCo Gaming#0258
Yah.


Philio Io#6139
you're arguing about cars


WillCo Gaming#0258
My dad's going to buy some OJ.  We're all out..


Toaster#2600
a real family never runs out of OJ
jk lol


Philio Io#6139
see, and its this dumb capitalist society that spells it OJ


Toaster#2600
speaking of the juice of oranges, ima go get some of those tasty fuit guts
or is it blood
cuz its juice
i guess pulp is like guts


Philio Io#6139
blood


Toaster#2600
ok ima go get some of that tasty fruit blood
brb


WillCo Gaming#0258
Also, the milk fell on the ground, so there's a giant stain on the street now.
But you know what they say:
*"No use crying over spilt milk."*


Philio Io#6139
but there is use


WillCo Gaming#0258
False,..
What is my punctuation?


Toaster#2600
i have returned


Philio Io#6139
that's like if you are poor, "oh, there goes our family's only nutritious drink for the week that was all gone the first day, no point in crying over spilt milk, our kids are just going to become malnourished"


Toaster#2600
oof
large oof


WillCo Gaming#0258
We have more milk.


Toaster#2600
not if youre poor


WillCo Gaming#0258
Got milk?


Philio Io#6139
but if you're poor
that's why i said that


WillCo Gaming#0258
Yeah.


Philio Io#6139
because im sure milk isn't the only nutritious drink in your house


WillCo Gaming#0258
Well, we have water.  And more milk.


Philio Io#6139
exactly


GoldenPot8o#2294
well, lets think about this, if the rine is the skin, then the equivilant of meat and guts would be the actual edible parts, however the actual juice is blood, so the human equivilant of oj would be if you removed the skin and bones and then blended the rest of the blood, tissues, and organs


Toaster#2600
hey go join @streemin bros if you think youll be on streams a lot


WillCo Gaming#0258
And yes, the water has nutrients.  A whole 0 calories!
They tried to sell us Diet Water, but nop.


Philio Io#6139
hey toaster you should make a @streemin bros but call it @ streemin bros but gayer so that i can join and only be on the stream at night
oof, that second one wasn't supposed to turn blue
there we go


Toaster#2600
lol


WillCo Gaming#0258
just do \@streemin bros
\@
ugh


Toaster#2600
that still @'s them


WillCo Gaming#0258
WHY
\!
\@
\@blah


Toaster#2600

WillCo Gaming#0258
backslash

why dont work!?


Toaster#2600
that still @'s them


WillCo Gaming#0258
\@Toaster
ya

GoldenPot8o#2294

Toaster#2600
@Philio Io#6139 @streemin bros nite


Philio Io#6139
huh


Toaster#2600


WillCo Gaming#0258
How the hecc do I install betterdiscord themes?


Toaster#2600
you download them


Philio Io#6139
by being gud


Toaster#2600
pro tip: instead of getting themes and plugins just get the pluginrepo and themerepo plugins


WillCo Gaming#0258
Well, I put a theme in the themes folder, but it isn't showing up.


Toaster#2600
how


Philio Io#6139
maybe ur not gud


Toaster#2600
like send a screenshot of your theme folder


WillCo Gaming#0258
This.


Toaster#2600
boi lol


Philio Io#6139
yeah ur obviously not gud


WillCo Gaming#0258
nop
obviously


Toaster#2600
take the theme you want out of that folder and then out of its own folder and into the themes folder
you cant just put the entire master folder of themes into the folder and expect it to install the themes in it lol


WillCo Gaming#0258
Poor design.


Philio Io#6139
yeah ur not very gud are you


Toaster#2600
plus isnt the only theme in there the basicbackground
basicbackground isnt even gud get an actual theme


WillCo Gaming#0258
Boi.


Philio Io#6139
git guuuuud


WillCo Gaming#0258
WHy do you think there's only a background in there?


Toaster#2600
am I wrong?
whats in it?


WillCo Gaming#0258
Yas


Philio Io#6139
because your not very gud


Toaster#2600
whats in it
scrensho


WillCo Gaming#0258



Toaster#2600
whats in themes


WillCo Gaming#0258



Philio Io#6139
not gud stuff


Toaster#2600
what the heck master folder did you install
doesnt matter
point is


WillCo Gaming#0258
This was literally the only place I could find this theme/


Toaster#2600
yeah ew why
install that
get the pluginrepo and themerepo plugins
then just go into themes on discord and install them from the repo


WillCo Gaming#0258
BD needs a better website.


Toaster#2600
what can you do ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø


WillCo Gaming#0258
Not much.


Toaster#2600
yeah
pluginrepo and themerepo


Philio Io#6139
i think that you guys need to git gud


Toaster#2600
get those
ima brb


WillCo Gaming#0258
Would I need to restart discord to install the things?


Toaster#2600
hello fellow comrades


WillCo Gaming#0258
Oh hey, my theme got applied.
Yay.


Philio Io#6139
ur a theme


Toaster#2600
oof


WillCo Gaming#0258
It looks gud.


Philio Io#6139
no
it needs to git gud


WillCo Gaming#0258
Pretty gud.
Nice and non-boring/


Toaster#2600
mine is prolly better


WillCo Gaming#0258
This is the theme.


Toaster#2600
yeah ew


Philio Io#6139
i thin kyour nice and nonboring


Toaster#2600
jk its nice
but still i like mine bettre


WillCo Gaming#0258
I like it.
It's a nice change.
Also, the accent color.
Hold on while I set windows to that as well...


Toaster#2600
just fixed my serverfolders too


Philio Io#6139
yours looks trash tost


Toaster#2600
its better than wills lol


Philio Io#6139
nah


WillCo Gaming#0258
nah


Toaster#2600
also youre just jealous you dont have themes


Philio Io#6139
i like wills more


WillCo Gaming#0258
thanks


Toaster#2600
ok fine


Philio Io#6139
wills is simple


Toaster#2600
how bout this one


WillCo Gaming#0258
Is okay.


Toaster#2600
you guys are just boring lol


Philio Io#6139
i still like wills more


WillCo Gaming#0258
Looks like somebody took material design and mangled it.


Toaster#2600
wills is literally just discord with red accents
p boring


Philio Io#6139
exactly


WillCo Gaming#0258
red accents, reskined icons, and better status indicators


Philio Io#6139
it takes something already good, and makes it better
yours completely ruins it


Toaster#2600
no, it really doesnt
it just makes it look way nicer


Philio Io#6139
yuh huh


Toaster#2600
wills just added accents
thats the only noticable thing


Philio Io#6139
nuh uh


WillCo Gaming#0258
Dude, yours has WAY to much transparency.
Mine also has animations and cool stuff.


Toaster#2600
too*


WillCo Gaming#0258
Too


Philio Io#6139
wow nice, you found a grammatical error
you won the argument


Toaster#2600
also still ew, thats just adding unnecessary things


WillCo Gaming#0258
Nah.
Animations look nice.


Toaster#2600
I'd rather have an intersting BG than accents and animations
also why red there are so many better colors


WillCo Gaming#0258
Also, makes the window titlebar a whole lot better.


Philio Io#6139
i think thats dumb


WillCo Gaming#0258
and it isn't red.
it


Philio Io#6139
red is a sickk color


WillCo Gaming#0258
is pinkish red
gay red


Toaster#2600
thanks for the compliment
and its red will stfu
red = red


WillCo Gaming#0258
red-red=0
math
but the titlebar is so much better
actually uses that space


Philio Io#6139
2+2=4-1=3


Toaster#2600
I should switch my BG though ive been using this one forever


WillCo Gaming#0258
the default titlebar succs


Philio Io#6139
quick mafs


Toaster#2600
oooooooooooooooooooooo i found one me likey


WillCo Gaming#0258
???


Philio Io#6139
it doesn't look good


Toaster#2600
a theme


WillCo Gaming#0258
Show.


Philio Io#6139
it doesn't look good
ew


Toaster#2600
no because you guys have trash taste in themes and will just say it looks bad lol


Philio Io#6139
i cant look anymore
its so bad


WillCo Gaming#0258
Has phil even seen it?
And besides, there's always a chance I'll like it.


Toaster#2600
nahhhhhh


Philio Io#6139
gross
its so bad


Toaster#2600
oof what is this though


Philio Io#6139
OwO


Toaster#2600
i cant tell if its the theme or discord glitching out lemme reload
hi again


WillCo Gaming#0258
But tost, the reason your theme succs is it completely overuses transparency, and without using any blur.
If there's tranparency, ya gotta have blur.


Toaster#2600
okay good


WillCo Gaming#0258
Show
screenshot


Toaster#2600
also you realize that the theme i showed you literally was only blur right
the entire BG was blurred in that screenshot


WillCo Gaming#0258
Boi.
No.


Toaster#2600
yes it was lmao
it it 100% blurred i just switched back


WillCo Gaming#0258
Ya gotta have the bg sharp, and then only blur when it's behind stuff.
Jeez.
Ever seen the win10 start menu?


Toaster#2600
it only un-blurs if I go to options or something


WillCo Gaming#0258
Ew.


Toaster#2600
that does make me slightly salty thought that it doesnt un-blur when its not behind anything
but its not that bad
still a good theme


WillCo Gaming#0258
Eh.


Toaster#2600
also by that logic youd hate the one i just found anyways so no go away


WillCo Gaming#0258
I think, for that theme, just make the corners more square, space things out more.
And fix the blur.
Then it would be hot.


WillCo Gaming#0258
Oh ye.


Toaster#2600
ugh this theme big gay


Philio Io#6139
dude thats hot


WillCo Gaming#0258
How big a gay is it?
I am gay expert.  I will tell how gay it is.


Toaster#2600
it doesnt scrool down when a new message sends unless i send it so i have to manually scroll down every new message
other than that I like it but thats sorta a deal breaker


WillCo Gaming#0258
Oh.


Philio Io#6139
thats hot


WillCo Gaming#0258
Dude, my normal discord was doing thattt.


Toaster#2600
yeah its so annoying
hold on
okay ima just deal because for some reason BBG isnt working and im too lazy to manually install it


WillCo Gaming#0258
BBG?


Toaster#2600
basic background


WillCo Gaming#0258
Ah.


Toaster#2600
oof I would love this theme if it werent 100% transparent (I get what you mean will but transparency isnt always bad) and if the selected things didnt look gross
when you select things it shows as a gradient from transparent>black>light blue and it looks so gross
it shoulda just been transparent>light blue


WillCo Gaming#0258
Oof.
Ew.
that sounds bad


Toaster#2600
oh me sorta likey
I like the text size/font of material discord but I wish I could add a background.
I guess ill just deal


WillCo Gaming#0258
Had another slick theme, but it did so much flicker.
Had to delet.
RIP in peace.
üò¢


Toaster#2600
it makes me sad when good themes have glitches


WillCo Gaming#0258
Same.
Especially when I'm using Linux.
*(Installs gud theme)*
*(Theme glitches)*
*(Can't see buttons to delet theme)*
*( üò¢ )*


WillCo Gaming#0258
I should use linux more.


Toaster#2600
ew


Philio Io#6139
ew
linux is for nurds


WillCo Gaming#0258
Eh.  If I'm not doing a game, there isn't a whole lotta reason to do Windows.
And I'm getting tired of Win.
I want my Adapta theme again!


Toaster#2600
ew


WillCo Gaming#0258
This is pretty.  Don't dis it.
Now, I must consume sustenance.


Toaster#2600
ew


GoldenPot8o#2294

Philio Io#6139
I always stick with a nickname until toaster changes it


WillCo Gaming#0258
This nickname's not my favorite, but it's grown on me.
Also, apparently it's a 40 minute walk from my house to the high school.

Jonathan, do you known how to travel without being driven by a family member?


JONKKKK#4186
nop


Zildin#0532
Bus, bike, walk


WillCo Gaming#0258
It's called  walking.  Or riding a bike.


Zildin#0532
Like actually


WillCo Gaming#0258
Or the bus.


Zildin#0532
Bikes are great


JONKKKK#4186
bus is beinG DRIVEN


WillCo Gaming#0258
yas
bikes are great
But jonk.


JONKKKK#4186
you edITED YOUR POST
hAH


Zildin#0532
Yeah because having a father drive you is very much lazy


WillCo Gaming#0258
BE LESS LAZY, JONK.


Zildin#0532
And I did that before you answered


JONKKKK#4186
i didnt even rlly wanna go


WillCo Gaming#0258
excuses...


Zildin#0532
So you blame it on the fact that your dads not home?
Just say I don‚Äôt want to go


JONKKKK#4186
well
ok


Zildin#0532
Like


WillCo Gaming#0258
Don't be bad at life.


JONKKKK#4186
i  wanted to go enough to where I would go if i could be driven


Zildin#0532
Use a bike


JONKKKK#4186
but not enough to bike/walk/bus


WillCo Gaming#0258
Kids these days.  ü§¶üèº


Zildin#0532
Gravity will drive you half the time


WillCo Gaming#0258
ueet


JONKKKK#4186
i didnt wanna go badly enough to walk


Zildin#0532
From a friends house to my house i have a solid one uphill and it‚Äôs slight and small.
I pedaled then and only then
Gravity


JONKKKK#4186
yeah but its all uphill from my house


WillCo Gaming#0258
From the library to my house, I barely have to pedal.


Zildin#0532
And?


WillCo Gaming#0258
Also jonk, its good for you
Get some gosh darn exercise.


Zildin#0532
I went up uphill like 95% from my house to a friends house the other day
Uphills aren‚Äôt hard


WillCo Gaming#0258
I bike uphill almost daily.
It's freaking easy.


Zildin#0532
If you stop just friggin walk it


WillCo Gaming#0258
I'm completely outta shape.


Zildin#0532
Same tho


WillCo Gaming#0258
Also, walking is actually harder than biking.


Zildin#0532
Yeah but it‚Äôs hard to start going on an uphill


WillCo Gaming#0258
Because you have to use energy to stand up.
On a bike, you're sitting.


Zildin#0532
Yep
It‚Äôs fun


WillCo Gaming#0258
Am I the only one who dismounts my bike while it's still moving?


Zildin#0532
Probably


WillCo Gaming#0258
Like, I'll slow, get off, walk the bike, without stopping.  I find it easier than dismounting while stationary.  Harder to fall over.


Zildin#0532
Cool
I‚Äôm just like nah. Ill stop


WillCo Gaming#0258
But stopping takes time.
I'm a busy person.
I can't just, like, stop moving.


Zildin#0532
Oh god I‚Äôll looks weird without the apostrophe


WillCo Gaming#0258
Ill


Zildin#0532
Just
|||


WillCo Gaming#0258
Ill means sick.


Zildin#0532
Is that an I‚Äôll idk
What
Wat


WillCo Gaming#0258
Ill ease hung over the group.
That was in a book, read it like the roman number three
3 ease hung over the group.
Can we just say 3 instead of 'sick'?


Zildin#0532
I don‚Äôt know
If I‚Äôm is a contraction of I am then why don‚Äôt people say stuff like, your not going to *insert location*, I‚Äôm.


WillCo Gaming#0258
No, you aren't going to ?
ugh
fff
uck


Zildin#0532
Wat


WillCo Gaming#0258
i think it'd be a

Hi


Nikdane12#3216
Jonk pleas come tomorrow :(


Toaster#2600
ew


Philio Io#6139
will and connor are nurds
also, what do you mean uphills are easy?
you think you can bike up everest?


Zildin#0532
No
That makes no sebse
Uphills and fucking mountains are different Phillip


Philio Io#6139
that is completely not true
have you ever went mountain biking?
it's called MOUNTAIN biking for a reason


Zildin#0532
If its a smallish slope vs a mountain than it is
And I havent


Philio Io#6139
a smallish slope is easy, but that doesn't mean that ALL uphills are easy


WillCo Gaming#0258
boi


Philio Io#6139
that's one of the most generalized statements i have ever heard


Zildin#0532
Most are


WillCo Gaming#0258
no fucking duh


Philio Io#6139
bruh


Zildin#0532
Worst case scenario you slow down and stop. It‚Äôs not too hard to not fall over


Philio Io#6139
i thought they were all easy?
that means you need no exertion to complete them at a reasonable speed
*little to no


Zildin#0532
Why are you the only one here who really gives a fuck


Philio Io#6139
ima eat dinner, we'll continue this later

Philio Io#6139
Im the only one arguing because what you're saying completely diminishes the practice of biking
by calling it easy, you're saying that the people who are the best in the world a biking aren't very talented
which isn't true


Zildin#0532
I don‚Äôt really care right now
Ok
The only ‚Äúhills‚Äù arent steep and the worst thing is that I stopped and had to walk a little bit
If you want to go bike up a mountain go ahead. I don‚Äôt really cafd


Philio Io#6139
The hills are steep, have you tried biking up urban hill?


Zildin#0532
?


Philio Io#6139

so

5a+ch31.exe#9554
@GoldenPot8o#2294 how long you there 4?


GoldenPot8o#2294
prolly til 8


Toaster#2600
i get you going to the teen center so you have a decent comp but whyd you want jonathan to come lol


GoldenPot8o#2294
well, hes slightly better than nikolai (no offense)


Toaster#2600
no i know but what does having him there accomplish
all he wants to do there is play a switch anyways


GoldenPot8o#2294
@JONKKKK#4186 they have vr today


JONKKKK#4186
oo


GoldenPot8o#2294
also ive done a ton of work on the park so yeah you should come
@JONKKKK#4186


JONKKKK#4186
i dont have anyone to take meeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee


GoldenPot8o#2294
buas
here ill even find out how to get you there
ok


GoldenPot8o#2294
leave your house at 1:20, walk to the highlighted bus stop (you want the one on the right side of the street), ride that bus to the transit center, get off at the transit center, get on the route 1 bus (downtown circulator) ride that until it says "now approaching trinity and oppenhiemer" pull the loop of leather next to the window and get off at the stop, cross the street to the police station and walk to the teen center from there
@JONKKKK#4186 did you get that?


JONKKKK#4186
im eating rn


Toaster#2600
also i still dont understand why you want him there so bad
he just does vr and a switch and thats like it


JONKKKK#4186
^^


Toaster#2600
even if he does planet coaster its not like youre doing anything, hes just playing a singleplayer game and youre watching him
its like when i used to make you guys come over except its like if you wanted to come over
all i do is play singleplayer games and edit, why would you want to come over
@GoldenPot8o#2294


GoldenPot8o#2294
i have multiplayer games that we could play, and to quote you, someones being passive-agressive
its nice to have friends to interact with


Toaster#2600
but jonathan doesnt interact
also im just bored because im not at home
need something to do


GoldenPot8o#2294
jonk did you miss the bus


JONKKKK#4186
yea


Toaster#2600
obv lol


JONKKKK#4186
i was eating lol


WillCo Gaming#0258
Yaknow, Jonk, You can walk.


JONKKKK#4186
nah
i dont even wanna go to the teen center that much


GoldenPot8o#2294
vr


Toaster#2600
he *has* vr


JONKKKK#4186
ye lol


Toaster#2600
thats like trying to get me to go to the teen center by saying that they have computers there that might be slightly better than mine
maybe ill go see it once (rgb compters are cool lol) but other than that idrc


WillCo Gaming#0258
Most of the comps there are slower than mine.


JONKKKK#4186
well
they have games i dont have


Toaster#2600
its cuz all the teens download dumb shit and it gunks up the computers
also on VR you mean jonk?


JONKKKK#4186
ye


Toaster#2600
meh
still wouldnt really temp me
maybe you tho i guess


WillCo Gaming#0258
I went to the Teen Center to play CS once, and the framerate I was getting was shit.  So I pulled out my laptop, and things were better.
THe wifi there is fast tho.


Toaster#2600
were you on the mac


WillCo Gaming#0258
Ew.  No.


Toaster#2600
for some reason the mac there runs csgo like shit but every other one is decent


WillCo Gaming#0258
Not the one I was using.


Toaster#2600
oh it mghtve been because of the epic games launcher
if that was open it mightve killed it


WillCo Gaming#0258
hmm


Toaster#2600
its usually set to auto open because teens are retartdd


WillCo Gaming#0258
And that is why public comps are succ.
I have a few apps set to auto-open, but not many, and they like never open, because my comp's always on.  Actually, I don't think I have any auto-open apps atm.
Also, one of the lights in my kitchen just burnt out.


Toaster#2600
i have discord, steam, MAYBE chrome, rainmeter, voicemeter


WillCo Gaming#0258
I swear, though.  My computer reminds me of me sometimes.


Toaster#2600
thise are my main auto opens


WillCo Gaming#0258
I don't use rainmeter.  I would, but the HiDPI support is complete and utter shit.


Toaster#2600
hidpi? high dots per inch?


WillCo Gaming#0258
Because freaking Windows thinks that BITMAPS are appropriate for text.
And yes, High Dots Per Inch.


Toaster#2600
what
dpi is a mouse thing
how does that affect rainmeter


WillCo Gaming#0258
No, DPI is a screen thing.  Look it up.
It means basically nothing.  It's an umbrella term denoting screens with many pixels in one place.
Like a 4k display.


Toaster#2600
so you mean resolution
you say DPI and people think mouse
just say resolution


WillCo Gaming#0258
Most of the places on the internet that I spend time, if someone says HiDPI, they're talking about pixel density.
But true.  I apologize for the confusion.

But still.  It wouldn't be a problem if Windows didn't use bitmaps so often.


Toaster#2600
just make a custom skin


WillCo Gaming#0258
You know what?  That's an idea.


Toaster#2600
it is indeed an idea
you could also look on r/rainmeter
see if thees a 4k one there


Toaster#2600
wait nate pls explain
i havent even been home for a week how have i been a dick
@GoldenPot8o#2294
and also you havent even said anything about this until now, there is such a thing as a feedvaxk channel if you dont like something about this server
i guess its suggestions but cool
also ima get rid of that announcment , i feel like having a mod promote a server against the owner is sorta a not good thing lol
If youre wondering what it was, it was him telling you to hit him up if youre ‚Äúinterested in a server where toaster isnt as much of a dick‚Äù


Toaster#2600
so yeah make sure to hit him up

I love just using Google Translate's Latin translator to mangle phrases.
By translating to latin and back over and over.
SOmebody give me a phrase.
I found a prase that only gets mangled a little.  Not even noticeably.
Give a man a fish, he will eat for a day.
Teach a man to fish, and he will eat for a lifetime.
becomes
Give a man to fish, he will eat today.
Teach a man to fish, and he will eat for a lifetime.
One round of latin translate makes the Preamble a little dystopian.
Now we have received from the people of the United States of America, in the Order to form a more perfect Union, establish justice, after the death of domestic peace, provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare; and secure the blessings of freedom for ourselves and our posterity, that ordain and establish this Constitution of the United States of America.
The final outcome:
freedom and security benefits to us and our children, and to organize and establish this Constitution of the United States of America.


Philio Io#6139
ay bs im back


Henlotra#8955
it was almost 3 months ago that suggestions was last used. idu
lol this is the only channel im on that has almost everyone online
*server


Toaster#2600
√¶
give a man a fish and he will eat for a day, dont teach a man to fish and feed yourself. hes a grown man. fishings not that hard.


WillCo Gaming#0258
It's not easy.


Toaster#2600
its a quotteeee
its just a jesttttttt


WillCo Gaming#0258
Teach a man to steal, and he wont have to eat fish every day for the rest of his life


Philio Io#6139
ITS JUST A JESSSSSSSST


Toaster#2600
dont teach a man to fish and you can get paid for fishing for him
basic economy
yay


Philio Io#6139
capitalism
make education way to expensive so you can't actually do anything


Toaster#2600
i feel like the issue is more the education system being stypid then expensive


WillCo Gaming#0258
ya


Toaster#2600
i guess its stupid because it costs too mixh to not be stupid
so
hes right


Philio Io#6139
that's the problem with like high school and stuff, but for college its just to expensive


Toaster#2600
well maybe just get good
i bet i deranked in csgo becayse i havent played in so long
nice


Philio Io#6139
jokes on you because i don't have a rank, so i cant derank


Toaster#2600
hah
i dont even mind deranking because it just means i play with ppl way worse than me
or smurfs
smurfs are annoying


Philio Io#6139
according to my brother, if you get ranked as silver, then you might as well make another account because you will never get into a better rank


Toaster#2600
haha yup
im sorta dealing with that rn because i deranked into silver and it makes me sad
i wish i was at least gn1


GoldenPot8o#2294
hey @JONKKKK#4186 can i come over
ill take that as a yes

Toaster#2600

i imagine he didnt even see these messages and you just arrive at his house like ‚Äúyeah you have to deal with me now xd‚Äù
/s
did he see these? hes like never on here


WillCo Gaming#0258
And he should really set his status to idle or something


Toaster#2600

WillCo Gaming#0258
oof
THis is like the only server I *don't* have muted.

long switch statements are annoying
there needs to be a quicker or more compact way of saying if this then that
cuz right now this massive pillar of switch statements is in the middle of my code
switch (upgradeNumber) {
                case 1,2,3,4,5:
                  upgradePrice += 5
                  clickIncome += 1
                  break
                case 6,7,8,9:
                  upgradePrice += 10
                  clickIncome += 1
                  break
                case 10,11:
                  upgradePrice += 15
                  clickIncome += 2
                  break
                case 12,13:
                  upgradePrice += 20
                  clickIncome += 2
                  break
                case 14,15:
                  upgradePrice += 30
                  clickIncome += 2
                  break
                case 16,17:
                  upgradePrice += 50
                  clickIncome += 2
                  break
                case 18,19:
                  upgradePrice += 75
                  clickIncome += 2
                  break
                case 20:
                  upgradePrice += 100
                  clickIncome += 3
                  break
                default:
                  upgradePrice += 125
                  clickIncome += 3
                  break
              }
woah okay and its broken too
yay
ok nice I fixed it except now it looks like this
switch (upgradeNumber) {
            case 1:
            case 2:
            case 3:
            case 4:
              upgradePrice += 5
              clickIncome += 1
              break
            case 5:
            case 6:
            case 7:
            case 8:
            case 9:
              upgradePrice += 10
              clickIncome += 1
              break
            case 10:
            case 11:
              upgradePrice += 15
              clickIncome += 2
              break
            case 12:
            case 13:
              upgradePrice += 20
              clickIncome += 2
              break
            case 14:
            case 15:
              upgradePrice += 30
              clickIncome += 2
              break
            case 16:
            case 17:
              upgradePrice += 50
              clickIncome += 2
              break
            case 18:
            case 19:
              upgradePrice += 75
              clickIncome += 2
              break
            case 20:
              upgradePrice += 100
              clickIncome += 3
              break
            default:
              upgradePrice += 125
              clickIncome += 3
              break
          }

WillCo Gaming#0258
Although, why have the taskbar visible at all times if you're going to have launchers on you desktop?


Toaster#2600
because having the taskbar not visible messes with non fullscreen programs and its dum
also its small anyways
plus some launchers are like websites anyways so
google, reddit, soudncloud
now it looks like this because i moved the CPU stuff to another monitor


WillCo Gaming#0258
How does the non-visible taskbar mess up non-fullscreen apps?


Philio Io#6139
in my experience, i would sometimes move my mouse down so it would pop up, and then it would just ruin everything


Toaster#2600
for some reason with a bunch of programs it just makes a blank area in the window when you can see the desktop
uh no i just tried it again and it works
nvm


WillCo Gaming#0258
@Toaster#2600 the resolution on those pics is garbage

Did you ever hear the tragedy of Pickle Ree The Wise? I thought not. It‚Äôs not a story the Normies would tell you. It‚Äôs a Fanbase legend. Pickle Ree was a Dark Lord of the Fanbase, so powerful and so wise he could use the Sezchuan Sauce to influence the show to create episodes‚Ä¶ He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Sezchuan Sauce is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful‚Ä¶ the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. Ironic. He could save others from death, but not himself.

When you catch a shiny articuno in only 1100 soft resets

Come at me


Philio Io#6139
Why articuno


Speguni#3116
He was to only legendary I hadn't already caught in that game
I also caught a shiny mewtwo in only 700 soft resets


Philio Io#6139
Ooh


Speguni#3116



Philio Io#6139
Very nice


Speguni#3116
I'm just insanely lucky


Philio Io#6139
Yeah, ive only run into two shinys in total, and only caught one of them
Makes me sad


Speguni#3116
What happened to the other one
Also what were they


Philio Io#6139
Gligar (which i didnt catch) and some legendary i forgot which


Speguni#3116
Aww shiny gliscore would have been so cool


Philio Io#6139
Yeah, but i didnt have any pokeballs, so it was pretty reeeworthy


Speguni#3116
Aww that sucks
I've run into three shinies in hg discluding the garydos that you get


Philio Io#6139
Oh right, but i dont really count the gyarados


Speguni#3116
Yeah neither do I
I have a noctowl


Philio Io#6139
The gligar was in ss, but the other one was in white i think for me


Speguni#3116
Oh well that narrows the legendaries down
Reshirqm and zekrom were shiny locked in that game


Philio Io#6139
Yeah i remember it being one of the obscure ones


Speguni#3116
Ooh was it an event pokemon?
Cause that would be really cool


Philio Io#6139
No, i remember it being a pokemon you catch after the elite four, but it had a weird name
For some reason it reminded me of verizon
The phone service


Zildin#0532
Verizion?


Speguni#3116
Oh was it kyurem


Zildin#0532
I think I spelled t right


Speguni#3116
Yeah
You got it
Kyurem may have been shiny locked though idk
Do you still own the copy?


Zildin#0532
Me?
And which game?


Speguni#3116
No


Philio Io#6139
Nah restarted the game


Zildin#0532
Oh
Ril
Rip


Speguni#3116
Nooooo
I wanted to know the shiny


Philio Io#6139
Lol


Philio Io#6139
Im pretty trash though, so i usually restart games and then see how far i can get in one sitting


Toaster#2600

Zildin#0532
Thank you for noticing


Speguni#3116
Let us enjoy somethi g for once dammit


Toaster#2600

Speguni#3116
But it was through the ultra wormhole so ehhh
Doesn't really vount
Count


Zildin#0532
Remember the event for x and y and  ORAS where you could get a hint xerneas and a shiny yveltal?


Speguni#3116
I have both of them


Philio Io#6139
I stopped playing after black and white 2, because i am a purist


Zildin#0532
I had both copies when that happened so...


Speguni#3116
To be honest heart gold will always be my favorite


Philio Io#6139
I like leaf green the most


Speguni#3116
That's understandable


Zildin#0532
In Diamond the game sort of glitched out and I had infinite rare candied

Oren_BrickBoy#3376
jeff

Toaster#2600
new bg babee

haha just kidding I just found a triple monitor bg



WillCo Gaming#0258
Not bad.  But...
I'd move the clock on desktop one to desktop tow.
And put the clock on desktop two in the corner of desktop one.


Toaster#2600
there you big turd /s
also I didnt put it in the corner becaue for some reason that skin is gay and has a massive hitbox(?) dunno if you call it that for rainmeter skins lol


WillCo Gaming#0258
Ooof.
I usually have the opposite problem.
The text will overflow the hitbox.


Toaster#2600
oof


WillCo Gaming#0258
because I usually have to double the font size to get the HiDPI to behave.


Toaster#2600

Speguni#3116

JONKKKK#4186
idk lol


UrBoiTre#8106
he probably has an i7 core right
ill ask him when hes on


WillCo Gaming#0258
Well of course he has an i7.
What else would you use?  An *i5*???


Toaster#2600
I dont
I have a threadripper 1950x


WillCo Gaming#0258
Hmm.


Philio Io#6139
get oofed


Toaster#2600
16 core


WillCo Gaming#0258
What's the manufacturer?


Toaster#2600
AMD


WillCo Gaming#0258
Okay.


Toaster#2600


UrBoiTre#8106
tf 750$ id rather us NZXT


WillCo Gaming#0258
Yeah, as somebody who doesn't custom-build PCs, I tend to forget that there are actually non-Intel chips that don't succ.


Toaster#2600
I have an NZXT cooler


UrBoiTre#8106
nice


Toaster#2600
ill make a part list and send it one sec


UrBoiTre#8106
k
whats ur cs:go fps


Toaster#2600
um
isk
idk
100+ prolly but idk


UrBoiTre#8106
cause nzxts bld service theres a 1400$ pc thats runs it at 220 and fortnite at 104


Toaster#2600
well running csgo at 220 fps isnt exactly hard


WillCo Gaming#0258
Yeah, I'm using a non-gaming laptop, and CS is very much playable, even at 2160p.


UrBoiTre#8106
not as easy when u have a shitty pc


Toaster#2600
well you know what I mean
whatever PC thats on there probably isnt near as good as mine
flexin xd
but actually


UrBoiTre#8106
ill probably try to get a decent pc or just stick to xbox


WillCo Gaming#0258
TO SHOW YOU THE POWER OF FLEX TAPE, I SAWED THIS FLEX TAPE IN HALF.
I'm so sorry.


Toaster#2600


UrBoiTre#8106
is this the one u built in va


Toaster#2600
nope
one I built in VA is wayyyy worse


UrBoiTre#8106
yea


Toaster#2600
probably about $700 instead of $2500


UrBoiTre#8106
i need dat $



Toaster#2600
yeah ew dafuq
thats not even that good by normal pc standards


WillCo Gaming#0258
Win10 home?


Toaster#2600
i5 cpu, 1070 gpu, 16gb ram


WillCo Gaming#0258
A CORE i5!?


Toaster#2600
not very good


WillCo Gaming#0258
ew
the RAM's what I have on my laptop
this thing is worse than my laptop
and for the same price


UrBoiTre#8106
yea it is cause normal pc cant even get 100fps


WillCo Gaming#0258
really


Toaster#2600
not really


UrBoiTre#8106
and this is just one of their defaults btw


WillCo Gaming#0258
how much drive space does that comp have?


Toaster#2600
500gb


WillCo Gaming#0258
That's about what I have.
But still.
Don't ever buy an i5.


Toaster#2600
I have 2TB plus a 500gb ssd


WillCo Gaming#0258
Ever.


UrBoiTre#8106
ill go through and make a real one


Toaster#2600
I could make you a WAY better pc for that same price
plus custom builts are plenty cheaper than prebuilts


WillCo Gaming#0258
Yup.


Toaster#2600
just by plugging those SAME specs into pcpartpicker you can get it 200 dollars cheaper


UrBoiTre#8106
i dont even have the money 4 it anyway lol
wish i did tho
ill stick with console 4 now


WillCo Gaming#0258
ew


UrBoiTre#8106
what


Toaster#2600
consoles are bad


WillCo Gaming#0258
specifically, console SHOOTERS are bad


UrBoiTre#8106
not that bad


Toaster#2600
nah
consoles in general are bad


WillCo Gaming#0258
Have you tried aiming in a console shooter?


UrBoiTre#8106
yes its not hard


Toaster#2600
no yeah console shooters are bad but consoles in general are very not good


WillCo Gaming#0258
I have played a few good console games (terraria and smash)


UrBoiTre#8106
compared 2 pc


WillCo Gaming#0258
but once you've used a mouse, aiming with a joystick is rediculously clumsy


Toaster#2600
using anything console is bad


UrBoiTre#8106
i play both and they arent hard to get used too
*to


Toaster#2600
but anything console is bad


WillCo Gaming#0258
Tost, that's not entirely true


UrBoiTre#8106
thats your opinion


Toaster#2600
yeah it is


WillCo Gaming#0258
Some Wii games are fun.
And the story driven games on the PS.


Toaster#2600
consoles have locked framerate, very minimal choices, settings are almost nothing
hardware-wise theyre overpriced, locked behind dumbass paywalls(thats not hardware but yknow), and really just notv very good


WillCo Gaming#0258
PlayStation's nice because it has games with stories, whereas Xbox is shooters and sandboxes all over the place.


Toaster#2600
THATS ANOTHER THING


WillCo Gaming#0258
Also, friking xbox runs Windows.


Toaster#2600
console exclusives are so stupid


WillCo Gaming#0258
Ya.
I would give so much to play something like Detroit on my computer.


Toaster#2600
emulationnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn
except its probably not emulateable yet


WillCo Gaming#0258
And I especially hate exclusives, because I used to have a Mac.
And you know how many games are non-Mac exclusive.


Toaster#2600
thats not exclusives, thats just macs being apple and most of everyone using windows


WillCo Gaming#0258
Yeah.
And lately Mac's been going downhill fast.


Toaster#2600
well i mean
was it ever not bad


UrBoiTre#8106
no


WillCo Gaming#0258
I mean, after using Win10 for a month, I went on my Mac, and the lack of a fucking start menu drove me insane.
Also, for some fucking reason, Mac won't let you unpin the fucking file manager from the fucking dock.  I don't want to look at it unless I'm using it, and I'm not.
The biggest bit of vanilla customisation in Mac is turning off desktop icons, and you have to know the terminal to do that.


UrBoiTre#8106
but a great console player can definitely go up against pc players


Toaster#2600
haha no


UrBoiTre#8106
yea


Toaster#2600
nope


WillCo Gaming#0258
Yeah, against bad PC players.
But not against good PC players.
Not in an FPS, especially.


Toaster#2600
mouse&keyboard is WAY more responsive and doesnt have any of the movement limitations at all


WillCo Gaming#0258
The PC gamers will turn around in .1 seconds, while the Console gamer will take .5


UrBoiTre#8106
but console have aids for that


Toaster#2600
plus TVs (which you typically use for consoles) have a lower refresh rate
you mean the aim lock


UrBoiTre#8106
i use a monitor


WillCo Gaming#0258
Also, most tvs are really shit displays.


Toaster#2600
aim lock removes all skill from games


WillCo Gaming#0258
And the aimbot isn


Toaster#2600
if a game has aimlock youre either using hacks or its a bad game


UrBoiTre#8106
im talking about aim assist


WillCo Gaming#0258
if you're going against mous&keyboard gamers, you use your hands


Toaster#2600
aim assist is aimlock
its aimlock with another name


WillCo Gaming#0258
I don't get a robot exoskeleton in gym class, and you don't get aim assist against PC gamers.


Toaster#2600
I guess you could say its like aimlock hacks with settings turned down


UrBoiTre#8106
you get aim assist when on a controller on pc


Toaster#2600
no you dont


WillCo Gaming#0258
Nop.
You don't.
PC games don't have that coded in, usually.


UrBoiTre#8106
on certain games then


Toaster#2600
no not usually
as i said youre either using hacks or its a bad game


WillCo Gaming#0258
The closest I've seen was a system that just highlights an enemy when you aim at them.
in PC games, you use your skills.
Not your bot.


UrBoiTre#8106
fortnite is the biggest game rn and it has aim assist for controllers on pc and takes aim assist away when using kb&m on console


WillCo Gaming#0258
Fortnite's a shit game, imo.


Toaster#2600
yeah fortnites very not good


WillCo Gaming#0258
They do some cool meta stuff, but the game itself is not good.


UrBoiTre#8106
battle royale is terrible but i play the save the world part


WillCo Gaming#0258
And really, aim assists on PC are cheap.
Especially if your enemies are bots.


UrBoiTre#8106
but most pc players will have a good pc and dont just play for whatever


Toaster#2600
what


WillCo Gaming#0258
that makes no sense


Toaster#2600
explain "play for whatever"


WillCo Gaming#0258
in coherent english please


UrBoiTre#8106
they take it more seriously than ppl who play on a console
most of the time


WillCo Gaming#0258
I don't think it's possible to take Fortnite seriously.


Toaster#2600
people who play on pc do take games more seriously because they can play the games they want, change the settings they want, and have better controls


UrBoiTre#8106
im not specifically talking about fortnite rn


Toaster#2600
im not either
oh you were talking to will


UrBoiTre#8106
yea


WillCo Gaming#0258
WIth other games, yes, people take them seriously.
They also don't use aimbots, unless they're cheaters.


UrBoiTre#8106
but i agree with u @Toaster and do to that they will invest more into hardware to optimize their experience and style
*due


WillCo Gaming#0258
We also invest more into software.


UrBoiTre#8106
yea


WillCo Gaming#0258
Because you can actually customize a PC's OS.
Even in Windows.


UrBoiTre#8106
yep
im into pc's heavily, just dont have the money for them


Toaster#2600
idrc about customizing my OS, id maybe do it but as you said windows isnt the most customizable thing
at least its not as bad as mac


WillCo Gaming#0258
I'm a Linux nerd, though, so I will attempt to customize everything.
ANd when I can't, I get angry.
Settings apps are my favorite apps.


Toaster#2600
I'd rather be able to run the stuff i want to run then have customizability


WillCo Gaming#0258
That's why I dual-boot.
ALthough, I haven't used Linux in a while.


Toaster#2600
haha see im converting you /s


WillCo Gaming#0258
Maybe.


GoldenPot8o#2294
MMM
ok


UrBoiTre#8106

GoldenPot8o#2294

WillCo Gaming#0258
hecc
I see Toaster's discovered BrainFuck.


Toaster#2600
I knew about it earlier I just never really looked into it


Toaster#2600
multiple notes for multiple tracks overlayed as theyre played looks sorta cool

same with watching this stuff automate


UrBoiTre#8106
@Toaster#2600 do u use win10 home or pro?


WillCo Gaming#0258
really, unless you're a professional, there's no reason to use pro.  it costs a lot more, and doesn't add a whole lot.  if you're using it for gaming, just get Win10 Home.


UrBoiTre#8106
yeah i saw the only main difference i see is the amount of ram u can use in home which is 128 gb, which is more than enough


Toaster#2600
with home you can use 127gb, that depends on motherboard not OS
128*
also what you really want is windows workstation xd

okay something thats sorta dumb but would also be kinda funny is if you made a discord server where users could define global variables using a bot and then you have to talk using the bot using print() and stuff
like you cant talk normally you have to talk using python and stuff
itd be sorta dumb but me and jonathan just messed around like that for a while and it was sorta funny lol

Toaster#2600
hah
yeah im not in that server but he was spreading it around
I sent it in a couple places too
yeah my bots are mostly just me messing with javascript


PtitMax#4257
I use python for my bots
Only language I know yet


Toaster#2600
i switched to python just recently but I used to do only javascript


PtitMax#4257
Python is so easy to learn, it's so intuitive


Toaster#2600
yeah its definetely easy to learn
its nice because its easy to learn but you can do alot with it


WillCo Gaming#0258
yup


PtitMax#4257
I learned it at school, but went way farther than what we do at school


WillCo Gaming#0258
THey teach almost no python in school.


PtitMax#4257
Hi


WillCo Gaming#0258
hi.


Toaster#2600
in comp science (at least here) they do some
he sorta just lets us do whatever they want


WillCo Gaming#0258
nice
In Robotics we just play with Legos.


Toaster#2600
lol


PtitMax#4257
I was in a school which has no equivalent outside of France, 2 years about Maths and Physics. And we had a bit of programming mostly in python


WillCo Gaming#0258
Nice.


Toaster#2600
but yeah in computer science he gives us things to do, like make rock paper scissors or battleship, but he lets us do it in whatever language we want


PtitMax#4257
That's cool


WillCo Gaming#0258
Yeah.


PtitMax#4257
Next week I'll begin a 3 years school in an engineering school about programming and computer science. So I'll know more than just python really soon


WillCo Gaming#0258
Nice.


Toaster#2600
thats pretty cool
yeah were all just
whoops
were all just messing with python and stuff


WillCo Gaming#0258
Nice.
I just mess with python on my own time.


Toaster#2600
yeah


PtitMax#4257
I'm messing around too, with my first bot, if you say hello, it says hello back with randomised text


WillCo Gaming#0258
Neat.


Toaster#2600
thats cool


PtitMax#4257
And if you have @someone in your text, it will tag someone at random in the server
I love that one


Toaster#2600
yeah as you saw with the stuff we were making thats just random word gen
hah that sounds sorta cool


WillCo Gaming#0258
@Toaster#2600 You should tell this one about the 700% accurate thing.


Toaster#2600
he came *from* the 700% accurate thing
i put a discord link in the code


WillCo Gaming#0258
Oof.


PtitMax#4257
900% ?


Toaster#2600
900% yeah
we have 100%, 200%, 700%, 900%, and im working on 1200% lol


WillCo Gaming#0258
Nice.


Toaster#2600
oh if you wanna do invite links you can put them in #promotion


WillCo Gaming#0258
That is how percentages work.  Totally.


GoldenPot8o#2294
We don‚Äôt even have a 100%


Toaster#2600
yeah we do
remember
100% accurate discord
the one I made
then you did 200% to one up me


GoldenPot8o#2294
That‚Äôs discord not humans


PtitMax#4257
I only wanted how it is in the script of the python 900%
300 to 600 ?


Toaster#2600
hm?


PtitMax#4257
You said 100, 200, 700 and 900. But what about 300 to 600?


Toaster#2600
oh hah

PtitMax#4257
When I'll have my bot ready to play The Werewolves of Millers Hollow, will you allow me to add to this server?


Toaster#2600
sure!


PtitMax#4257
Do you actually know the game?


Toaster#2600
nope ive actually never heard of it


Philio Io#6139
My cat made a blep


Toaster#2600
hah


PtitMax#4257
It is normally a card game, I think it's from France.
Anyway, you receive one card which you can look at but which stays hidden.
There are 2 teams : Townsfolk and werewolves.
Each team needs to kill the entire other team to win.
Each night, the werewolves eat someone, only them know who are the other werewolves
Each day, everyone vote to eliminate someone.
There are more cards than only those two :
The witch has 2 potions, one to kill someone, one to revive someone killed by the wolves. (she plays with the folks)
The seer can each night learn about the card of someone (she also plays with the folks)
And a party alternates between nights and days until one group is eliminated


Toaster#2600
OH okay so its like town of salem
have you heard of that?


GoldenPot8o#2294
its just less complicated


PtitMax#4257
Maybe


Toaster#2600
its a bit different but its close


PtitMax#4257
No
It's really easy to learn how to play it


Philio Io#6139
I‚Äôve played that, but it was just called werewolf


Toaster#2600
yeah It sounds really similar to town of salem
whenever you finish that add the bot! sounds fun


PtitMax#4257
I just looked for wikipedia's page to know the name of the game in english


Toaster#2600
okay yeah i gotcha
sounds like fun


PtitMax#4257
Well it's not ready yet, I wish that in 3 days, the first version will be ready


Toaster#2600
okay cool


PtitMax#4257
I may need some help to know if what I'm typing is correct in english


Toaster#2600
okay we can help with that


PtitMax#4257

@PtitMax#4257 when you say you‚Äôre going to school for computer science, do you mean university or just secondary school?


PtitMax#4257
I don't know what exactly each word mean, so I'm only going to say that I'm 22
But the people in my class will be mostly 20


Toaster#2600
thats probably university then


PtitMax#4257
Because I've spent a year away and the last two years, I was in the same class


Henlotra#8955
@Toaster#2600 just a question I‚Äôve probably asked you because I‚Äôm ded inside: HOW THE FUCK DID YOU GET SO MANY SUBS I ONLY HAVE 20 and that‚Äôs probably cuz I have fuckin trash content


GoldenPot8o#2294
all his vids were unlisted at one point after he made animation content, the subs stayed

JONKKKK#4186
*nates a terrorist confirmed*


Toaster#2600
yeah pretty much


JONKKKK#4186
hello 911?
uhhh i think nate did 7-11


Toaster#2600
911 its a 711


GoldenPot8o#2294
alright listen
terrorism is about sending a message right
well what would send a message better than burning it into the side of a building


Toaster#2600
i dunno man
burning stuff is pretty effective


GoldenPot8o#2294
alright thats pretty funny, haha
or damaging a landmark
also dont worry mr fbi agent in my computer, i wont actually do this its just an idea i had


JONKKKK#4186
dont listen to him mr fbi agent


GoldenPot8o#2294
man you're embarising me in front of the wizzards
also mr fbi, jonk is the one you shouldnt trust, hes short and wants to bring the downfall of tall things and people


JONKKKK#4186
nooOO
tall and short people can live in harmony


Toaster#2600
i feel like you could make a memey series about that


JONKKKK#4186
about what


GoldenPot8o#2294
oh sure just like robots and humans are equals
***bullshit***


Toaster#2600
short and tall people living in harmony
or ***WILL THEY***


GoldenPot8o#2294
isnt there a muppets spoof about that sort of thing
its like rated r
the happytime murders


GoldenPot8o#2294
***gasps and turns inside out***
***__another day in gmod could actually be good now that i can speak__***


Toaster#2600
eh


JONKKKK#4186
it might be fun if it actually has a coherent plot


Toaster#2600
___***why dont we just do real life sketches its more fun***___


GoldenPot8o#2294
bruh


JONKKKK#4186
n
no
its not
its just
cringey


Toaster#2600
dude
did you *watch* another day in gmod
it was so bad
and you say that irl would be more cringy than that


GoldenPot8o#2294
what if we did ***all of these ideas?***


Toaster#2600
that would just be worse


GoldenPot8o#2294
not combined ijit


JONKKKK#4186
also idk what another day in gmod is like bc you never uploaded it


Toaster#2600
its uploaded
its privated
you watched it
its bad
and nate itd still be worse


JONKKKK#4186
its kinda funny


GoldenPot8o#2294
what if we took the original thing, said what we liked and what we dont like and refine these ideas and do the ***g o o d   b o i***


Toaster#2600
okay
-i didnt like the video
thats it


GoldenPot8o#2294
boi as in
we rewatch it and dont nessesarily talk about the video, but the ideas in it


Toaster#2600
@JONKKKK#4186 @GoldenPot8o#2294 up for something?


JONKKKK#4186
nah not rlly


GoldenPot8o#2294
Gotta homework on them school nibbas
But later sure


Speguni#3116
Y'all got homework?


Philio Io#6139
You‚Äôre not allowed to say y‚Äôall
At least we‚Äôre in the Southwest


Speguni#3116
Virgina is considered southern


Philio Io#6139
Just because it was Confederate doesn‚Äôt mean its southern


Speguni#3116
I think that most people would say virginia is a southern state


Philio Io#6139
I think most people would be wrong


Speguni#3116
Northern Virginia is the least southern place ever but it as a whole is considered pretty southern


Philio Io#6139
Its fairly north, so thats dumb, but i am also out of touch with society so


Speguni#3116
Yeah I guess but go to somewhere like Williamsburg and that's where you'll find the racism and southern accents


Philio Io#6139
Lol wut
Racism i get
But the southern accents are dumb
Its not in the south
This is stupid


Speguni#3116
I mean it's just above the Carolinas


Philio Io#6139
Yeah


Speguni#3116
Which are pretty stereotypical south


Philio Io#6139
Thats like the edge maybe
Eh
I guess the ‚Äúsouth‚Äù isnt actually the south anymore


Speguni#3116
What do you mean


Philio Io#6139
I feel like the stereotypical new mexico person is actually in places like tennessee and kentucky, which are very north


Speguni#3116
Ok when you say north do you mean position wise?


Philio Io#6139
Basically, the bible belt is considered the ‚Äúsouth‚Äù
Yeah


Speguni#3116
Ok yes position wise I agree with you but the south isn't only defined by position
In the US at least


Philio Io#6139
Lol
Thats a contradiction
Which is why i find it kinda dump


Speguni#3116
The American south doesn't just mean position south it's about the state itself


Philio Io#6139
Yeah, but its just so weird


Speguni#3116
I guess
I don't know I've grown up with grandparents in the south so it somewhat makes sense to me


Philio Io#6139
And yet I‚Äôve lived my whole life in the actual south, and it doesn‚Äôt make sense
Lol


Speguni#3116
South West and south east are pretty different


Philio Io#6139
You‚Äôre pretty different
Gottem


Speguni#3116
DUDE
NOT COOL
How could you


Oren_BrickBoy#3376
a


Philio Io#6139
Sorry man, sometimes my racism flares up and i become very patriotic to new mexico


Speguni#3116
I just can't deal with those kind of insults
I could be in the hospital for weeks


GoldenPot8o#2294
HOLD ON A FUCKING SECOND
BECAUSE OF THE DEFINITION OF MEME, RELIGION IS JUST ONE BIG MEME

WillCo Gaming#0258
That face, though...


Toaster#2600
wow haha almost like that was the joke


WillCo Gaming#0258
I know, right?


Toaster#2600
@WillCo Gaming#0258 the outro of that vid wasnt even very hard to make just saying
thanks anyways tho lol


Toaster#2600
ok lmao
you know how mr beast used to be semi cringy but he was a big meme cuz he did the fidget spinner 24 hour thing
hes still pretty popular and gets sponsored a ton so he has lots of money and he sORTA flexes but its a lot more of him just being nice and funny lol


Speguni#3116
Alright


Toaster#2600
its top quality
he essentially is like
if our friend group all had insane amounts of money


Speguni#3116
The one thing I know he dis was but the car with pennys
Did


Toaster#2600
rn im watching him drive around in tiny kids police cars with his friends and pretending to fine people and just giving them money
high quality stuff
they just gave a dozen donuts to the head of police lmao


Speguni#3116
Sounds pretty good
What did the policeman say


Toaster#2600
he did one thing where he donated 50k to ninja's charity livestream for cancer but ninja had rules where it was like "for $250 you can make me drop whatever gun in my game of fortnite" and the whole video was just him trying to screw over ninja
also the police wOMAN thank you
she just said thanks lol


Speguni#3116
Oh ok
Yeah I heard about the ninja thing


Toaster#2600
yeah


Speguni#3116
He started that whole trend didn't he


Toaster#2600
idk but i think so
as i said its basically just if our whole friend group had way too much money
and were all in our 20s


Speguni#3116
He seems like he's just trying to throw away money


Toaster#2600
its kinda funny lol
i get how some ppl could find it annoying because its like hes constantly flexing on you but i just think its funny lol


Speguni#3116
Yeah but he's flexing in stupid ways


Toaster#2600
yeah


Speguni#3116
Like fucking buying a car with pennys


Toaster#2600
instead of like "xd i have way more money than you ur stoopid" like ricegum hes just
yeah
that
hes just destroying his friends cars that they hate and then buying them ones that are 10x more expensive


Speguni#3116
What a prank


Toaster#2600

and ubering people with a tank


Speguni#3116

Toaster#2600

Speguni#3116

Philio Io#6139

LoserLeague#6148
Boi
I‚Äôm heading to Colorado
So no


Toaster#2600
oof
@GoldenPot8o#2294 @JONKKKK#4186 lets do something
I feel like coding


JONKKKK#4186
then code


Toaster#2600
i half want a big project to work on but at the same time i dont because i feel like ill get bored
also i have nothing to code and coding together would be fun


JONKKKK#4186
make a program that tries to simulate discord


Toaster#2600
thats not super interesting though
its just like
random number gen


JONKKKK#4186
no but you have to also try and get the responses right
like
try and simulate whole conversations


Toaster#2600
but for that youd need either an INSANE amount of if statements (or classes or functions or vars or wtv) or machine learning or soemthing
which I still do sorta wanna do, get a bot to take everything we say in discord and make it try to make a conversation


JONKKKK#4186
yeah try and learn it


Toaster#2600
machine learning you mean?


JONKKKK#4186
ye
