Toaster#0403
why have you not existed like all day

GoldenPot8o#2294
Just didn’t feel like it

GoldenPot8o#2294
I decided not to exist today

Toaster#0403
well you missed the premiere screening of the news episode

GoldenPot8o#2294
Eh

Toaster#0403
and also lost the opportunity to record the next one

GoldenPot8o#2294
Really?

Toaster#0403
mhm

GoldenPot8o#2294
How was it explained is all I care about

Toaster#0403
what do u meen

GoldenPot8o#2294
How was my absence explained

Toaster#0403
oh we didnt record it

GoldenPot8o#2294
?

GoldenPot8o#2294
What

Toaster#0403
i was saying we coulda recorded it

GoldenPot8o#2294
Oh

Toaster#0403
everyone was online and ready to do it except u

GoldenPot8o#2294
Nah it’s ok

GoldenPot8o#2294
Idrc

Toaster#0403
its annoyin for me tho

Toaster#0403
cuz i do in fact enjoy editing

Toaster#0403
and also it woulda been a really fun one to record since we all switch places

GoldenPot8o#2294
We already suck at uploading on time

Toaster#0403
also now it is canon that liam is better than u at science and you always try to be way cooler than him and either mess up or he does better and u cant no u because you werent here

GoldenPot8o#2294
And this was like one time compared to jonk and Liam’s like 20 times each

Toaster#0403
yeah that makes it worse

GoldenPot8o#2294
What

Toaster#0403
because the ONE TIME they were both here is the ONE TIME you WERENT here

Toaster#0403
literally any other day probably woulda been better

GoldenPot8o#2294
Jonk is because he has gay ok

Toaster#0403

GoldenPot8o#2294
To the tune of Katy Perry’s hot n cold

Isa_Manz#3758
Cause you're hot then you're cold
You're yes, then you're no
You're in, then you're out
You're up, then you're down
You're wrong when it's right

Isa_Manz#3758

-fortnite 2

GoldenPot8o#2294
jonathan at one point: fortnite is just oversaturated trash

uhh

JONKKKK#4186

JONKKKK#4186
nate

GoldenPot8o#2294
no

JONKKKK#4186
fortnite is filled with cancer

GoldenPot8o#2294
that was literally your fucking arguement

JONKKKK#4186
apex isnt

Toaster#0403
**jonathan at one point:** wow fighting games are bad and also battle royale genre bad

GoldenPot8o#2294
