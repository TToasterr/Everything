# Discord bots
Some Discord bots I may or may not continue.

---

## Toaster (Python, Finished/Abandoned)
A simple bot I used when first learning python bot making. Is abandoned really just since it's old and doesn't have many features.

## Toaster 2.0 (Python, Finished/Abandoned)
A bot that got relatively big, but I stopped adding to. Server specific storage is stupid, as everything is in it's own file. Some people did/still do use it though.

## Toaster 3.0 (Python)
A bot that I'm sort of still working on, but might just make a 4.0 as the way I did storage on this one is worse than file storage. Google Sheets API is dumb.

## ENB (Python, Abandoned)
A bot that would give you a discord message and ping you when you got a new email. The way I made it is stupid and really inefficient. Wish I had done it better, maybe I will eventually.

## TODOBOT/ASPB (Python)
A bot that lets you set reminders and such, might add more functionality later. Mostly just me testing subprocesses.

## Idea Bot (Python, Abandoned)
A bot used for voting on ideas. Abandoned, since my way of doing it was STUPID.
