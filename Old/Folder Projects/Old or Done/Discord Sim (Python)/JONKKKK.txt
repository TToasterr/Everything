JONKKKK#4186

Toaster#2600

JONKKKK#4186
k

Toaster#2600
nuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
no its not

JONKKKK#4186
the point is

Toaster#2600
cuz id be getting rid of the blocks

JONKKKK#4186
getting the materials is only HALF of it

Toaster#2600
jonathan

JONKKKK#4186
what

Toaster#2600
you dont understand the lenght it would take to make my builds without it

JONKKKK#4186
EXACTLY
BIG
BUILDS
TAKE
A **LONG TIME!**

Toaster#2600
alright gtg my dads bein mad at me cya
also
THATS TIME I DONT HAVE
cya

Toaster#2600
Jonathan could I pls use mc edit

JONKKKK#4186
dude

Toaster#2600
It's not like I'd use it for everything

JONKKKK#4186
just do it over several weeks

Toaster#2600
It'd probably take longer if I did it for everything
And no! I 1 don't have that attention span and 2 would have gotten bored with it and moved on by then

JONKKKK#4186
what do u want to build

Toaster#2600
Idk

JONKKKK#4186
well maybe
it depends
on what it is

Toaster#2600
I'm making a place kinda like the industrial district and I REALLY don't wanna spend the time hollowing out the whole place

JONKKKK#4186
AHAHAHA no u have to do that
thats a thing u have to do

Toaster#2600
What can I do then

JONKKKK#4186
suck
it
up

Toaster#2600
Also why? That seems like the thing you'd care the least about too

JONKKKK#4186
i thought u had to go...

Toaster#2600
I grabbed my phone on the way
Why is building everything block by block so important to u üòÇ

JONKKKK#4186
ok fine be a cheater i probably wont even go on it anymore

Toaster#2600
Nuuuuuuu

JONKKKK#4186
if u do it

Toaster#2600
XD
Okay
That's y I asked u
Cuz I don't want u to leave

JONKKKK#4186
ya srry
u know how much i hate cheating XD

Toaster#2600
But I still dk why you care so much about that XD id throw the blocks away

JONKKKK#4186
y r we saying XD so much?

Toaster#2600
Cuz
Bleck
I just don't have to endurance for long projects so I look for shortcuts and unless you want me going into like creative mode or something this is the best solution
That's why I want u guys to help me not cheat cuz without u is probably have cheated by now

JONKKKK#4186
ya XD

Toaster#2600
Ugh lel I srsly wanna now tho xD
I made a copy of our world and tested it out

JONKKKK#4186
was it gud

Toaster#2600
Yeah
I made a ton more progress than without it

JONKKKK#4186
but u might be able to do it. it depends

Toaster#2600
K
But like with the industrial place thing can I cuz I already started on it anyways sry XD I'll ask in the future tho
Also
Not like the whole thing
Just the layout
The red stone stuff I'd build by hand

XD

Toaster#2600
OKAY so Ethan started a server where you vote, yes? I joined, and I liked the Idea. but he became obsessed with it and was like 'REVOTE CUZ NOT EVERYONE VOTED!!!' It got the same result, and still not everyone had voted. He was begging us all to vote, so I left and said I dont want to be a part of the channel. A couple minutes later, I say that I like the idea and that I might start it on my channel, with a president rank and ppl vote. I said that itd just be a title tho, no actual power. He said I shouldnt do it, I asked why, so he responded with 'Itd be a fake democracy.' I responded with 'says the guy who hosts a channel that is a bunch of pre teens voting on who the leader of the meaningless server is.' From there on out, we had an argument, and eventually he posted something that he had google translated. Then he posted something in a language I cant remember the name of, as it was wierd and I dont really give a shit. I told him 'idrc' and he continued on to post the ENTIRE FCKING WICKEPIDEA ARTICLE TO THE LANGUAGE. Me and Molly had told him to stop multiple times, and eventually I pointed out to him that he was breaking a rule, (disobeying admins) andd he compared me to **HITLER**!! FUCKING HITLER! I got mad at him and i eventually went to bed. I wake up, go to school, get back, animate and watch youtube, then see that you are 'rebelling' and you know the rest.

terraria is boring in the same way
collect resources, build, craft, run out of resources, repeat

JONKKKK#4186
thats building

Toaster#2600
fighting

JONKKKK#4186
otherwise

Toaster#2600
go fight, die, rage, travel back, repeat

JONKKKK#4186
...

Toaster#2600
the argument game too
click, lose health, lose or win, repeat

JONKKKK#4186
fine. think of a game that ISNT like that

Toaster#2600
gmod
play for a couple days, get bored, download a couple new addons, play for a couple more days, download more addons, make a video, mess around with friends for hours at a time, do anyting you want, repeat
at least you got some variation
that isnt 'oh ima go with ranged weapons this time'

JONKKKK#4186
idk, u focus only on building and not progressing to the next fight and working your way up the boss ladder

Toaster#2600
I could focus on that
but at least I SLIGHTLY find building fun

JONKKKK#4186
also looking at any game like the list thing makes it boring

Toaster#2600
well how about this:
terraria! Gather resources just like any other generic open world game! Another 2D 'exploration' game! Fight many bosses, just like almost any other game ever in the universe ever! OH WOW SO MUCH FUN IM HAVING
see, if you wanted to justs get tons of materials and build a massive house together id have fun
but the whole 'survival' things has been done before and its really boring

JONKKKK#4186
XD

Toaster#2600
So if I want to call you I saw to Siri "call the king of the cats"
Say
Tre is the king of the trees
And as of the new year I'm the king of the toasters
Gotta go :3 I'll chat later

Toaster#2600
Hai :3
We're dropping off my gma and den heading home
@JONKKKK#4186

JONKKKK#4186

So should we do a skit
I think it'd be fun
And if we do what game should we do it on

JONKKKK#4186
sure
uhm

Toaster#2600
Gmod would be the best imo

JONKKKK#4186
idk
ye
probly

Toaster#2600
What should it be lol

JONKKKK#4186
idk

Toaster#2600
Two men are fighting over a toaster and it goes too far
Idk xD

JONKKKK#4186
I think it should invole me crouching in a tree going MREEH

Toaster#2600
XD yes
Yes I agree

JONKKKK#4186
THE WILD TREE KITTEH

Toaster#2600
XD
OMG
IT SHOULD BE ME SEARCHING FOR THE WILD TREE KITTY
IN THE WILD

JONKKKK#4186
XD

Toaster#2600
XD

JONKKKK#4186
XD

Toaster#2600
Hello, I'm toast wills, and welcome back to ___TOAST GONE WILD___!! On this episode, were going to be searching for the elusive, the dangerous, WILD tree kitty

JONKKKK#4186
YEES

Toaster#2600
I don't know what's gonna happen guys, but it's gonna be fun.
XD

JONKKKK#4186
*later, after some unwritten events/dialouge* MREEEH! MREEEEEEH! MREEEEEH!

Toaster#2600
I think it should involve me killing you and then another you coming in and going "HAH! That was just a duplica-" and then I kill that one if you, and this repeats sevral times until the real you runs away

JONKKKK#4186
neh

Toaster#2600
XD

JONKKKK#4186
because all it would be able to say is MREEEH

Toaster#2600
Oh true
What if one scene is me walking up to you saying "nice kitty" and then you go mreehh? And I get closer and you just pull out a weapon and attack me
And yell MREEEAAHHHHH

JONKKKK#4186
I think it should end with me jumping onto you screaming MREEEEH and then you die and i'm just like mreh.

Toaster#2600
YEAH xD

JONKKKK#4186
and then I walk away

Toaster#2600
and pull me after you

JONKKKK#4186
i dont think we can do that in gmod

Toaster#2600
Yeah we can

JONKKKK#4186
oh
eh, I think it's just better if I leave you there and its just like "THE END."

Toaster#2600
XD okay

JONKKKK#4186
and along the way you find the wild groud kitteh and the wild hole kitteh

Toaster#2600
lol yes
We can use PAC
Oh also you should download most of my addons

JONKKKK#4186
and with the wild hole kitteh it would just be a face in a hole like "mree"

Toaster#2600
Are you at home?

JONKKKK#4186
that would be the hole kittehs call
o ye
i am

Toaster#2600
Go to the workshop and download the PAC 3 addon
We're gonna need it

JONKKKK#4186
wats that

Toaster#2600
It's basically a skin editor

JONKKKK#4186

JONKKKK#4186
lol wiat
ok so um
what if we played something similar-*ish*

Toaster#2600
>.>

JONKKKK#4186
i have something in mind and its fun but a little ragey
skywars

Toaster#2600
boi no

JONKKKK#4186
y not

Toaster#2600
cuz
two things

JONKKKK#4186
its rlly fun

Toaster#2600
probably more
as i think of them
1) holy fuck have you seen how ragey i am at that
2)jesus christ its hard
3) minecraft is so boring
4) idk

JONKKKK#4186
why do u think minecraft is so boring

Toaster#2600
i dunno
i just lost interest in it
now to make it fun i have to cheat
and thas not gud

JONKKKK#4186
same but skywars is fun

Toaster#2600
no its not
look at the other 2 reasons

JONKKKK#4186
hard is good tho

Toaster#2600
no not really

JONKKKK#4186
OH GOD TWSS
OH MY GOD
XD

Toaster#2600
i prefer feeling like a boss and ruling over everyone like an evil dictator only to never be thrown down from my pedestal of mangled bodies from the people ive killed to get to that rank

JONKKKK#4186
so u like easy games

Toaster#2600
depends
i like hard games that im good at
aka not skywars

JONKKKK#4186
BUT
the only way to get good is to play

Toaster#2600
but i dont WANT to get good
in csgo im bad
but i actually want to get good
so im practicing
but i dont want to be good at MC minigames
soo

JONKKKK#4186
well
i dont rlly like csgo
its the EXACT same situation
well, without the rage

Toaster#2600
me and u vs bots?

JONKKKK#4186
1) its hard
2)csgo is boring

Toaster#2600
not when im on ur team

JONKKKK#4186
SAME WITH SKYWARS
oops srry 4 caps

Toaster#2600
no i speak from past experience when i say that even when im on a team with you its still really hard

JONKKKK#4186
idk but I ALWAYS accidentally hit caps lock on this keyboard
ugh
but ye
im *decent-ish* at skywars

Toaster#2600
im not
im like the level right above rock bottom

JONKKKK#4186
and im not good at csgo
same

Toaster#2600
at least when you play csgo and lose twice in a row you dont type in chat 'yeah this shit is fucking dumb im out you fucktards' and then leave

JONKKKK#4186
????

Toaster#2600
thats what i do
i lose
then i rage

JONKKKK#4186
rafe lol

Toaster#2600
and i usually swear alot
call people fucktards
then leave

JONKKKK#4186
but ye i dont wanna play csgo rn

u shud make ur own language

Toaster#2600
do you know how hard that is

JONKKKK#4186
not rlly
not language
more like font

Toaster#2600
you have to create an alphabet with letters not on your keyboard and then come up with pronounciations for the letters so you can combine them into words, and you would have to make so many words I dont even want to think about it

JONKKKK#4186
no
just write down ABCDEFG and so on and make a symbol for each letter

Toaster#2600
thats a code
not a language

JONKKKK#4186
ye
more like font
kinda
but
eeeeh
also if you wanna go above and beyond you could make grammar for it

Toaster#2600
what do you mean grammar for it XD its a code

JONKKKK#4186
like my language would be
Hi, how are you today? -> today you are how, Hi?
its more than making it backwards tho

Toaster#2600
yeah thats just a code

JONKKKK#4186
yeah basically
but it looks cool!

Toaster#2600

question: why did you put the spruce planks they ruin the theme and dont match with the color scheme at all

JONKKKK#4186
it allows pallate differentiation

yeah I get that but its not a good one
you used tons of light colors and then out of the blue just BAM dark color
it doesnt fit
i think if oyu want color diff you could use jungle planks

what even is one in the chamber

Toaster#2600
its a minigame where you have a sword, bow and one arrow. The arrow is a one hit kill and whenever you kill someone you get another arrow. The sword is wooden and is really hard to kill people with so you want to avoid it. Respawning would give you another arrow as well
im making in , regardless of if you help or  not
you can help if you want

gay

Toaster#2600
jonathan
it will not be fine

JONKKKK#4186
ye

Toaster#2600
stop lying yo yourself
people at our age our supposed to have at least tiny pricks of sense

JONKKKK#4186
XD it was like in 5th grade

Toaster#2600
not your book
the intro

JONKKKK#4186
how is it cringy

Toaster#2600
one sec
lemme find the email
okay
lemme explain something
its made with blender
theres no background
where are the particles
no audio
its grey
boring
intros are the stupidest things ever

JONKKKK#4186
ITS NOT DOOOONEEE

Toaster#2600
the music would be cringy
the picture would be worse

JONKKKK#4186
blender is used by pros

Toaster#2600
mmmmmmmhm
definetely
sure

JONKKKK#4186
ok i gtg

Toaster#2600
some do
but
are you a pro
no
do you know how to make particles
no
do you know the properties of animation
no
you are a coder not an animator jonathan stick with what youre good at
sorry I sound really mean
i promise if you do this you will regret it
ive done it

Toaster#2600
you will too

JONKKKK#4186
actually i took an animation class

Toaster#2600
ooooohhhh dang man
you must be so good at it then

JONKKKK#4186
ye im not a pro but im not a newb either

Toaster#2600
pardon me but I THOUGHT WHEN SOMETHING IS SUPPOSED TO LOOK LIKE IT HITS THE FLOOR IT STAYS LEVEL
sorry
maybe I just learned physics wrong
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

JONKKKK#4186
ye ik i need to fix that

Toaster#2600
honestly its just pretty bad overall its just a cut and paste intro copied off of some website
plus intros suck anyways

JONKKKK#4186
ill probably go with another thing

Toaster#2600
even without them being cringy

JONKKKK#4186
its not a ctrl+c ctrl +v intro
i made it from scratch

Toaster#2600
if you really need people to know your name just say 'hey its (name) here'
yes
but

JONKKKK#4186
so its not copy/paste

Toaster#2600
you copied the same style from a website
so
metaphorically speaking
its copy paste
thats like saying "NO JUST BECAUSE I TRACED DOESNT MEAN ITS COPY PASTE I STILL HAD TO DRAW THE WHOLE CHARACTER"

JONKKKK#4186
no
i didnt
i went to NO website

Toaster#2600
mmmmmmmmhm

JONKKKK#4186
no rlly

Toaster#2600
nate sent
me
the EXACT same thing
but it was website made

JONKKKK#4186
???

Toaster#2600
and was actaully BETTER THAN YOURS

JONKKKK#4186
send it to me

Toaster#2600
with a waatermark
lemme see if I can find it

JONKKKK#4186
wait he made that

Toaster#2600
yeah
on a WEBSITE
WITH A TEMPLATE
THATS HOW WEBSITES WORK

JONKKKK#4186
im recreating it for him

Toaster#2600
OFF A *TEMPLATE*

JONKKKK#4186
im not using it or there would be a giant watermark
thats WHY

Toaster#2600
wha
tt
are you talking about

JONKKKK#4186
because i dont want nate to have to pay TWENTY BUCKS to get rid of the watermark

Toaster#2600
im talking about you pretty much copying off a template from a cringy intro website

JONKKKK#4186
yes
and thats why

Toaster#2600
maybe you shoulda gotten him the watermark free intro instead of minecraft

JONKKKK#4186
but its not even the same thing

Toaster#2600
he obviously wants it more

JONKKKK#4186

HI

@JONKKKK#4186
hey
pls

JONKKKK#4186
if roses are red and violets are blue, then therefore by the communitive property blue is violet. and what two colors make violet? red and blue, so you need red to make violet, but since violet is actually blue you need red to make blue. but what makes red? that's right, the past tense of read. because the word you read the most in this equation? BLUE. YOU RED  BLUE, making violet. And since violets are actually blue that proves that what you just read not only blew your mind, but what you just RED (past tense) just BLUE your mind.

Toaster#2600
You wanna know what we did in math

JONKKKK#4186
what

Toaster#2600
Pretty much everything we learned in sixth grade
Even in seventh honors it was still just fuckin negative exponents and graphing points on a chart
Negative and positive slopes
Rate of change

JONKKKK#4186
whats the most advanced

Toaster#2600
I don't know

JONKKKK#4186
have you solved equations

Toaster#2600
I had a shitty class and a shitty teacher
Whadds you meab

JONKKKK#4186
like if x = 5x+25 what does x equal

Toaster#2600
Yeah we did that

JONKKKK#4186
ok, then you'll probably be able to go ta algebra 1b

Toaster#2600
We did < and > stuff

JONKKKK#4186

a lot of problems that took a while

Toaster#2600
Ugh

JONKKKK#4186
IF you get ms shina, she doenst grade the homework
she just looks at it

Toaster#2600
See this year I got the perfect combination of teachers so I got like no homework but that means it's gonna suck extra next year cuz I'm not used to it

JONKKKK#4186
so i just fill it in with random numbers >:D

Toaster#2600
So I'm just hoping I get lucky again

JONKKKK#4186

Toaster#2600

Toaster#2600
Why

JONKKKK#4186
on accident

Toaster#2600
What were ou using? Oak log and planks, stone bricks and what?

JONKKKK#4186
dark oak logs and planks, spruce planks, and stone bricks

Toaster#2600
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
gay

JONKKKK#4186
are you making your houses boxes?
like a square shape?

Toaster#2600
Oh I was just designing one wall
gay

JONKKKK#4186
ye but do u usually make them square?

Toaster#2600
I try not to but if I'm making a small cabin then we
Yes

JONKKKK#4186
BAD
BAD TOASTER
EVEN SMOL CABINS DESERVE TO BE SHAPED

Toaster#2600
No
Jonathan no
Just because a square is usually a bad design doesn't mean that it is ALWAYS a bad design

JONKKKK#4186
it almost always looks better to add at least a *bit* of shape

Toaster#2600
Wh
Eh
gay
Simple cabin = simple shape
Oh also I made a machine where it sends a message in chat that says "think someone's cheating?" And if you click it it sends a list of all the players online and if you click one of the players it kills them and deleted their items

JONKKKK#4186
nice

Toaster#2600
Right now it works with up to 5 people but it's expandable
gay

JONKKKK#4186
why are you making it like ur in 1.8?

Toaster#2600
I'm nit
Bot
Not

JONKKKK#4186
umm

Toaster#2600
Oh you mean with the new cams block things

JONKKKK#4186
why are there no chain command blocks or repeat command blocks
ye

Toaster#2600
We always have this discussion

JONKKKK#4186
you could make it much cleaner

Toaster#2600
It's because I'm more used to the old way and because it has a guarantee of workinf

JONKKKK#4186
you should try doing it the new way

Toaster#2600
If I remade the same thing with the new cmd blocks I bet something wouldn't work
Plus it's not like it'd be *much* cleaner anyways

JONKKKK#4186
also look at this
its not nearly done but
gay
i accidentally made it look like a church so i just went with it

Toaster#2600
I don't think you understand how much that color scheme needs some other colors jonathan

JONKKKK#4186
i KNOW
its not done!

Toaster#2600
But why are you doing that last
That's like the most important part

JONKKKK#4186
shape, then roof, then framing, then other stuff
it just helps me
idk why

Toaster#2600
Wwwwwhyyyyyyy
Your building style triggers me
How bout this
I don't complain about how you build and you don't complain about how I redstone/cmd block

JONKKKK#4186
okie dokie artichokie
the reason i do that is because your brain notices the shape and roofing first
then everything else

Toaster#2600
Meh

JONKKKK#4186
it was kind of just to practice shape
so this is what i do
First story shape
gay
also im building this as we speak so it's going to take a bit
and also can u call or no
Made some modifications to it
gay
Second layer
gay

Toaster#2600
Aaaahhh
Noooo
I'm triggered

JONKKKK#4186
whyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy

Toaster#2600
Cuz you finish the first flooor fiioorrrssstttt
Plus
Why is the top a doffereeennnttt shaaapppppeeeeee
It won't worrrrkkkkkk
Unles you want balconyies galore
And that's still woeeeeeeeerrrdddd

JONKKKK#4186
no it  just looks like it wont
it will

Toaster#2600
Jonathan noooooooooooo

JONKKKK#4186
they line up
it just looks bigger

Toaster#2600
Yeah but then balconies galore and it still is stranger
There should be like 2 balconies at most

JONKKKK#4186
no, there arent
there is ONE balcony
trust me, i checked

Toaster#2600
>.>
Then what are you gonna do with all the INSIDE BITS

JONKKKK#4186
its the next floor plan

Toaster#2600
WHAT
So there's just gonna be gross empty spaces in the roof

JONKKKK#4186
ugh
discord only shows like the upper half
so then theres just a bunch of stuff at the bottom
hang on
There
gay

Toaster#2600

Toaster#2600

JONKKKK#4186

Toaster#2600
If you build like this EVERYTHING YOU MAKE is gonna look like a church
Or some shit

JONKKKK#4186

Toaster#2600
Jonathan no
Stop
I'm leaving

JONKKKK#4186

Hi

Toaster#2600
@JONKKKK#4186

Toaster#2600
Hey
i know youre not here rn but when you get back and i get back we should work on something together
itd be a game where theres 2 players, each in a 16x16 bedrock room, (or at least a room they cant break out of) and theres a chunk of land in them. The concept would be, if one player breaks/places a block, it also breaks/places the block in the other players room too. The goal would be to get to the nether as fast as possible.
i think itd be hard, but possible and a fun project to work on.

Toaster#2600

Toaster#2600
hey dud

JONKKKK#4186
ehhh

Toaster#2600
>:||
i still dont understand how you find ksp interesting after all this time
558 hours
jeez

JONKKKK#4186
idk lol

Toaster#2600
but like seriously

JONKKKK#4186
idk
a lot of that is probably just leaving the menu screen open

Toaster#2600
how do you find 550 hours of nearly the same thing fun
and also no
probably not
knowing you

JONKKKK#4186
uuuuh yeah
i do that a lot

Toaster#2600
you probably have spent at least 500 hours playing ksp
garanteed

JONKKKK#4186
well i have 1100 hours of terraria

Toaster#2600
but at least in terraria theres a bit more room for variation
plus
i bet a bunch of that actaully is just menu

JONKKKK#4186
yeah
SAME WITH KSP

Toaster#2600
NOT REALLY

JONKKKK#4186
i hardly play ksp

Toaster#2600
boi
every time im on here youre playing ksp
every time at your house you wanna play ksp

JONKKKK#4186
that was when i was really into it ok?

Toaster#2600
psh yeah "i dont play ksp that much I just play it all the time"
'was'
dude you still are

JONKKKK#4186
this is my first time playing it in like a month

Toaster#2600

Toaster#2600
and every time ive come over youo just want to play KSP even though I really want to do something else
yes you are jonathan

JONKKKK#4186
no, that was like 2 weeks ago
*WHEN I WAS REALLY INTO IT*

Toaster#2600
you are saying that "oh its just the menu screen" "oh ive actaully been playing splatoon recently" "that was 2 weeks ago"
yeah because 2 weeks make *SUCH* a difference

JONKKKK#4186
still
you say 2 weeks a go was *used to*
so i *used to* play that a lot

Toaster#2600
that doesnt mean its that big a difference
plus

Toaster#2600
well i remember the update where they added redstone
and the one where they removed rubies
that doesnt mean i played it then

JONKKKK#4186
well i at *least* remember playing with the old aerodynamics

Toaster#2600
i remember playing on the first version of minecraft made

JONKKKK#4186
yeah but i didnt go back to the old version
i remember when ksp went to version 0.9
in 2014

Toaster#2600
i remember when mc went to version 1.7

JONKKKK#4186
yeah
i remember when they added horses
it was *weird*

Toaster#2600
what does that have to do with anything

JONKKKK#4186
idk
but lets stop this argument
its dumb

Toaster#2600
how bout you stop playing ksp
its dumb

JONKKKK#4186

HOLY CRAP

JONKKKK#4186
whu

Toaster#2600
THAT TOOK WAYYYY TOO MUCH WORK

JONKKKK#4186
whu

Toaster#2600
I FINALLY GOT THE SERVER TO WORK WITH MORE THAN 1 GB OF RAM

JONKKKK#4186
WHU

Toaster#2600
I HAD TO REINSTALL A DIFFERENT VERSION OF JAVA

JONKKKK#4186
does that mean I can play!?

Toaster#2600
not yet its started

JONKKKK#4186
YEET

Toaster#2600
and its also not port forwarded
so yeah one sec

JONKKKK#4186
;-;

Toaster#2600
dud its fine lol
anyways yeah lol
ill get it set up and tell you when its done
im dedicating 16 gigs to feed the beast alone
just because i can

JONKKKK#4186
ok

Toaster#2600
holy hell
okay so the server works

JONKKKK#4186
noice

Toaster#2600
im about to actually test it out and join but still
its up

Toaster#2600
okay holy heck
i finally was able to join

JONKKKK#4186
whu
oooooo

Toaster#2600
turns out that hosting a FTB server is annoying as all hell

JONKKKK#4186
how

Toaster#2600
but anyways it looks like everything is all set up other than the port forwarding

JONKKKK#4186
nice

Toaster#2600
also ill explain but dont interrupt

JONKKKK#4186
ok

Toaster#2600
okay so basically i got the ram thing working
but

JONKKKK#4186
oh wow
very interesting
*other interruptions

Toaster#2600
then i tried to join and it said 'fatally missing blocks and items' on my minecraft
lmao

JONKKKK#4186
oh really
that sucks
i feel for you man

Toaster#2600
and in the console that hosts the server it said I was missing the mod called mercurius or whatever
so then i googled it and turns out it just collects data

JONKKKK#4186
oh mercurius what does that mod do
oh wow

Toaster#2600
so i deleted it from the server
but then it still said the thing about missing blocks

JONKKKK#4186
*insert interruption here*

Toaster#2600
and so i googled around even more and that took a long time
and THEN i learned that it fixes if I copy the config files from my FTB client to the FTB server
so i did that and it finally workeddddddddddddd
anyways i just texted my dad about port forwarding so
now
we wait

JONKKKK#4186
ok lol

Toaster#2600
okay hold on
idk if itll work but it MIGHT

According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way a bee should be able to fly. Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground. The bee, of course, flies anyway because bees don't care what humans think is impossible. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Ooh, black and yellow! Let's shake it up a little. Barry! Breakfast is ready! Ooming! Hang on a second. Hello? - Barry? - Adam? - Oan you believe this is happening? - I can't. I'll pick you up. Looking sharp. Use the stairs. Your father paid good money for those. Sorry. I'm excited. Here's the graduate. We're very proud of you, son. A perfect report card, all B's. Very proud. Ma! I got a thing going here. - You got lint on your fuzz. - Ow! That's me! - Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000. - Bye! Barry, I told you, stop flying in the house! - Hey, Adam. - Hey, Barry. - Is that fuzz gel? - A little. Special day, graduation. Never thought I'd make it. Three days grade school, three days high school. Those were awkward. Three days college. I'm glad I took a day and hitchhiked around the hive. You did come back different. - Hi, Barry. - Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good. - Hear about Frankie? - Yeah. - You going to the funeral? - No, I'm not going. Everybody knows, sting someone, you die. Don't waste it on a squirrel. Such a hothead. I guess he could have just gotten out of the way. I love this incorporating an amusement park into our day. That's why we don't need vacations. Boy, quite a bit of pomp... under the circumstances. - Well, Adam, today we are men. - We are! - Bee-men. - Amen! Hallelujah! Students, faculty, distinguished bees, please welcome Dean Buzzwell. Welcome, New Hive Oity graduating class of... ...9:15. That concludes our ceremonies. And begins your career at Honex Industries! Will we pick ourjob today? I heard it's just orientation. Heads up! Here we go. Keep your hands and antennas inside the tram at all times. - Wonder what it'll be like?

Toaster#2600
i hate you

JONKKKK#4186
lol
- A little scary. Welcome to Honex, a division of Honesco and a part of the Hexagon Group. This is it! Wow. Wow. We know that you, as a bee, have worked your whole life to get to the point where you can work for your whole life. Honey begins when our valiant Pollen Jocks bring the nectar to the hive. Our top-secret formula is automatically color-corrected, scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured into this soothing sweet syrup with its distinctive golden glow you know as... Honey! - That girl was hot. - She's my cousin! - She is? - Yes, we're all cousins. - Right. You're right. - At Honex, we constantly strive to improve every aspect of bee existence. These bees are stress-testing a new helmet technology. - What do you think he makes? - Not enough. Here we have our latest advancement, the Krelman. - What does that do? - Oatches that little strand of honey that hangs after you pour it. Saves us millions. Oan anyone work on the Krelman? Of course. Most bee jobs are small ones. But bees know that every small job, if it's done well, means a lot. But choose carefully because you'll stay in the job you pick for the rest of your life. The same job the rest of your life? I didn't know that. What's the difference? You'll be happy to know that bees, as a species, haven't had one day off in 27 million years. So you'll just work us to death? We'll sure try. Wow! That blew my mind! "What's the difference?" How can you say that? One job forever? That's an insane choice to have to make. I'm relieved. Now we only have to make one decision in life. But, Adam, how could they never have told us that? Why would you question anything? We're bees. We're the most perfectly functioning society on Earth. You ever think maybe things work a little too well here? Like what? Give me one example. I don't know. But you know what I'm talking about. Please clear the gate. Royal Nectar Force on approach. Wait a second. Oheck it out. - Hey, those are Pollen Jocks! - Wow. I've never seen them this close.

hey dud
@JONKKKK#4186

I'm doing an iOS play through just cuz I'm bored
There are only 5 hot bar slots and it's annoying as heckk

JONKKKK#4186
see why i want the switch version?

Toaster#2600
Yes but I definitely wouldn't have spent money on it just to have it portable
I only reinstalled it because we've had it forever
I definitely wouldn't have re bought it

JONKKKK#4186
yea lol

Toaster#2600
Not worth it imo

JONKKKK#4186
also wth is up with my world gen?
gay

Toaster#2600

JONKKKK#4186
lol

Toaster#2600
gay

JONKKKK#4186

Toaster#2600
Enchanted sword, ancient cobalt armor, climbing claws and other climbing thing (I forget it), Hermes boots, haven't defeated eye of Cthulhu but have like 3 spawners

JONKKKK#4186
im currently: still afraid of slimes

Toaster#2600
Cloud in a bottle and magic mirror too
lol whatta nerd
I started this today too so
I've probably only been playing for like an hour more than you

JONKKKK#4186
well im on expert mode

Toaster#2600
Well on iOS there is no expert mode
Otherwise I'd probably be too

JONKKKK#4186
yea

Toaster#2600
There's no medium world either lol
It's just "normal world" or "expanded world"

JONKKKK#4186
yea ios version sucks

Toaster#2600
Mhm
It's all I have tho

JONKKKK#4186
also:
current housing situation:
gay

Toaster#2600
Lmao
gay
My current house
I've put way more effort into exploring and stuff rather than building cuz building is atrocious in ios

JONKKKK#4186
i built the majority of it in litterally 5 seconds

Toaster#2600
Same dud

JONKKKK#4186
no, LITTERALLY FIVE SECONDS

Toaster#2600
Yeah ik
Me too
It took like
Nothing

JONKKKK#4186
i died, respawned, realised it was night, then spammed blocks around me
yea but you probably put actual effort in instead of just self defense

Toaster#2600
I just realized I needed storage and crafting stuff
Just because I put effort doesn't mean it took more than 5 seconds

JONKKKK#4186
so you're saying you started
started placing
then litterally this amount of time later:
you were done

Toaster#2600
Yeah essenrially
The only thing that took a small amount of time was making the crafting stuff but that doesn't really count
Help
Please

JONKKKK#4186

Toaster#2600

JONKKKK#4186
o boi

Toaster#2600
Want me to show you how to add em

JONKKKK#4186
yea

Toaster#2600
Okay I'll need to explain stuff so don't just do it right away
Go to dynobot.net
It'll probably want you to log into discord
Select my server
And go to autoresponder
Boom magic
Also if you want to add pics you have to get a link so post em here or somewhere
Then right click and copy the discord link
The put it as the response
Magic
Now I'm scared

Toaster#2600
Heck
I was browsing the animating room in the Hyuns dojo discord and saw someone doing pixel animation for a game and I'd be really fun to do but I have no idea how to code and you're too lazy to do it
Also pixel animation is hard as fuckxcccfsccd
Maybe it'd be fun to try to get into it by doing a fan made spinoff/sequel to a game or something
It'd be easy since you wouldn't have to come up with character designs and you could just build off of what's already there
I'm way too tired at this point I'm just saying rando shit because I'm bored
I dunno
It'd be fun to do but it'd also work lol
*literally anything ever*
Heck
Have you played geometry dash subzero
Rubrubs testing new things like camera movement and it's lit
Also going backward in a level is gonna be a thing

JONKKKK#4186
woa

Toaster#2600
Yeah it's cool
What do you think of the first couple things I said lol

JONKKKK#4186
ehhh
maybe
ive been binge watching game design videos today lol

Toaster#2600
Rly ha
Is it something you'd wanna do
I think it'd be semi fun
At least at first lol
I dunno
I want to make sprites but it's pointless if I'm not doing it for anything
What game would you want to design if you made one

JONKKKK#4186
probably something like cuphead

Toaster#2600
A 3D one in an engine, a 3D one without an engine, 2D with engine, 2D without engine
We could make a rage game lol

JONKKKK#4186
nah
ya wanna know what im doing rn?

Toaster#2600
Hm

JONKKKK#4186
building machines for our new alien overlords

Toaster#2600

Toaster#2600

The epitome of "if it's news it's true, and if it has to do with my kids, it's extra true"
How did she react lol

JONKKKK#4186

Did she think it was true
Did she bug you about it

JONKKKK#4186

itd be fun to make it like pony island but idk

JONKKKK#4186
story driven or no

Toaster#2600

idk why but I want to make a game with a bunch of secrets n stuff

JONKKKK#4186

okay lets just make a list, pin it, and update it as we go

JONKKKK#4186
k

Toaster#2600
-Story, but more puzzles/levels
-2D
-Castle crashers/POE like design
-More story-driven than CC, and much more mysterious
-'The king is diong bad stuff and lots of secrets and magic are happen'
Pinned a message.

JONKKKK#4186
you do realise im slightly introverted, right?
like

Toaster#2600
yeah lol no youre not

JONKKKK#4186
well i took a test

Toaster#2600
youre the one who says 'its only embarasing if youre embarased'
thats the fucking opposite of an introvert

JONKKKK#4186
well

Toaster#2600
an introvert would try to say or do as little as possible
in public

JONKKKK#4186
uhh
no

Toaster#2600
while youll do the most stupid and humiliating things without thinking twice

JONKKKK#4186
it just means you get tired of human interaction sometimes

Toaster#2600
thats

JONKKKK#4186
at least thats what its like for me idk

Toaster#2600
thats basic human stuff

JONKKKK#4186

Started a call.

JONKKKK#4186
According to your results you appear to be the type of person who enjoys socializing with both large and smaller, more intimate groups of people. You don't mind being around big crowds, but that doesn't mean you'll want to crash every party you're invited to. Having an active social life and extending your network of friends is relatively important to you, but it isn't the most crucial thing. You've managed to strike a great balance between actively involving yourself in your larger social network, and spending some quality time with a few intimate friends. Although you may not always be the conversation-starter or the "life of the party", you are generally a very outgoing individual, whether among friends or people you are less familiar with.

You remember my dream?
Steam

JONKKKK#4186

Toaster#2600
Autocorrect
Okay username is fireblasttorsten
Pass is theavner
And you need a gamemaker account too so just use mine
The email is fireblasttorsten@gmail.com
Pass is theavner0403
Also I do recommend using the drag and drop mode just because you already know a lot of it with scratch and also if you wanted to code you have to learn gamemaker language anyways so
Sucky that it uses its own language but wtv

JONKKKK#4186
its not working

Toaster#2600
?

JONKKKK#4186
nvm

Toaster#2600
Like it won't launch or what

Toaster#2600
What about risk of rain
Oh also pro tip

JONKKKK#4186
i wanna mess around with this music thing

Toaster#2600
Once you've installed a game from my account, you can just sign back in as you and find the exe for the game in steamapps or whatev and shortcut it to your desktop and play like that
Won't let you play online pretty sure but hey
Still pretty good
Later, at least, you should try risk of rain just so we know if you actually want me to get it for you
Good way to know if you *really* want games that I have lol
Tell me if you wanna do ror and I'll send you the login for my other acc

JONKKKK#4186

there
gay
yea
i had to go to a site
it wanted me to download it
so i did
but it said in order to do that i had to install an extention
and i was like "lol no"
and then i saw "download to dropbox"
so i did that
and then i had to create an account
and then i had to save the song to dropbox
and then i had to download it onto my computer using dropbox

JONKKKK#4186
ALL to convert a .wav to a .mp3
so...

the row/column youre in and a 1 block radius around it
that seems fair
now I get to have the fun times of making objects out of each sprite i just made

JONKKKK#4186
hang on
so like

Toaster#2600
?

JONKKKK#4186
if your character was the dot

Toaster#2600

gay

Toaster#2600
what
hold on
lemme draw my version

JONKKKK#4186

Toaster#2600

gay

JONKKKK#4186
?????????
why not below you??
WAIT
OHHHHHHHHH
nvm

Toaster#2600
if you were here youd see this
gay
etc etc

JONKKKK#4186
yea ok

Toaster#2600
you think thats good?
@JONKKKK#4186

JONKKKK#4186
i was thinking youd be able to see in like a 5x5 radius of you

Toaster#2600
eeeeehhh

JONKKKK#4186
and the cam is zoomed in and follows you
wait
hol on

Toaster#2600
I like the idea of a static camera and you just have my view

JONKKKK#4186
will the cam follow you?
oh
ew

Toaster#2600
we could have an in game option for it

JONKKKK#4186
i like the cam following you
and then

Toaster#2600
cam follows you and you get the view of the whole cam or the cam doesnt and you get my view

JONKKKK#4186
you know in that pacman game how when you run into a ghost it does a thing?

Toaster#2600
what

JONKKKK#4186
like it slows down time?

Toaster#2600
you mean the pacman i have
oh yeah
walls should be like that

JONKKKK#4186
we should do that with walls
yea

Toaster#2600
lol ye

JONKKKK#4186
and ded ends

Toaster#2600
i dont think it really stops you at walls

JONKKKK#4186
pacman?

Toaster#2600
it stops you automatically for half a second at intersections, and if you run into a turn where you cant go straight it just stops
no i mea the game
it shouldnt

JONKKKK#4186
ohh
i think it should still stop you
BUT for less

Toaster#2600
and then if you hit a dead end THEN it slows down time
like okay
this is a bit complicated but basically if you go into an intersetion from a red side itll slow you for half a second and then keep going. If you hit it from a green side, it stops you completly and lets you choose. That wonky one in the middle where half is green and half is red means if you hit the red side first (came from below) youd slow, if you hit the green side first (came from above) youd stop.
gay
hard to explain
and any dead end would go slomo

JONKKKK#4186
wait
why would you slow from the bottom?

Toaster#2600
because you have the option to go either right or up (in the same direction you came from)
if there was a wall up and youd run into it, it wouold stop you
but because an option is to keep going up, is just slows you to let you know you can go right
and if you came from above, if you tried to keep going strait youd hit a wall
so the green stops you and says 'hey the only way you can go is left, press that button you heck'

JONKKKK#4186
ohhhhh
you could also go up

Toaster#2600
yes
that too
but you get it right

JONKKKK#4186
ye

Toaster#2600
k
good
internets about to shut down
byw

I'm actually like cranking this out
Probably doing stuff wrong tho lol
Ima stop sending pics of the stuff cuz I'm lazy

Toaster#2600
okay I know youre probably on the bus or getting ready but i think we mght have to have it so if you hit any wall you die
like if you come in at a T intersection from the side thatll hit a wall going straight, if you dont press a key you die
just because itd be way more difficult not to
oh wait
im not smart
i already implemented something that doesnt do that
ignore me lol

Yea it's LIT

Toaster#2600
and i wanted a free shooter lol
but seriously we need to find a game we both enjoy
and that you wont quit in a week

JONKKKK#4186
dodging bullets, reaching over your shoulder, grabbing a shotgun, shooting it, throwing it and reaching over with your other hand to get a pistol and shooting a spooder thing coming to get you
Is
LIT

Toaster#2600
yeah that seems pretty easy to put on normal controls

JONKKKK#4186
But it's not the sameeee

Toaster#2600
other than something like dodging bullets which could just be a super fast quicktime event

JONKKKK#4186
What about grabbing a bullet

Toaster#2600

see above

JONKKKK#4186

i think you should practice in csgo
like not a real game just practicing aiming and stuff
i feel like youd have a lot of fun if you got slightly better

JONKKKK#4186
meyb

Toaster#2600
I created a 470% accurate learning curve of csgo
gay
but we should just get on an aim map, turn on sv_showimpacts and then practice aim
maybe on harmless bots or something
also I doubt youll find this very helpful but heres spray patterns
gay
shows you how to compensate too
wanna do it in a bit
@JONKKKK#4186

JONKKKK#4186

Toaster#2600

Toaster#2600
im sorta tempted to save up and buy a graphics card thats more expensive than my entire computer
just to get that quality performance

JONKKKK#4186
you should give it to me

Toaster#2600
naaaaaaaaahhhh i doont really feel like spending 1.3 k on someone other than me

JONKKKK#4186
UGH WHY ARE YOU SO SELFISH NYEHHHH

Toaster#2600

JONKKKK#4186

Toaster#2600
oh no
i guess youre right

JONKKKK#4186

muahahaha

Toaster#2600
this graphics card alone is more than a wacom cintiq
and my entire computer combined
like
this would essentially triple the price of my comp

JONKKKK#4186
you should get an oculus rift

Toaster#2600
they have rules against phones

JONKKKK#4186

fun fact: I know I treat my opinion as fact but its not because I think they are. Splatoon is a decent game, and if I felt like putting effort into it id probably enjoy it a bit and when I do stuff like say "No splatoon is gross" its usually just to make people like connor salty because its really entertaining

Toaster#2600
I tried to be super e d g y cuz i was bored lol

***MAN I WISH I HAD FRIENDS THAT PLAYED GAMES WITH ME SO I DIDNT HAVE TO ALWAYS PLAY THE SAME GAME BECAUSE ITS THE ONLY ONE I SLIGHTLY ENJOY BY MYSELF LOL LMAO ROFL GOTEM XDDDDDDDDDDD***

JONKKKK#4186
i REALLY wish subnautica was multiplayer
that would be AMAZING

Toaster#2600
nah cuz I dont wanna spend a buncha mon on a game I wouldnt real enjoy
its sorta like astroneer

JONKKKK#4186
its SPOOKY

Toaster#2600
its real fun at first and then just turns into way too much grinding

JONKKKK#4186
no but seriously
its borderline horror game
and subnautica isnt *too* much grinding

Toaster#2600
it sorta is tho

JONKKKK#4186
*some*, but not *a lot*

Toaster#2600
no but there is sorta a lot

JONKKKK#4186
i think the worst part of the late game is how spooky it is

Toaster#2600
you are constantly out getting resources and shit just to build one thing
is dum

JONKKKK#4186
but in subnautica
exploring and grinding is actually kinda ***fun***
IDK HOW THEY DO IT
its like

Toaster#2600
uh

JONKKKK#4186
the world is so coole

Toaster#2600
its not really

JONKKKK#4186
and also terrifying

Toaster#2600
any grinding isnt really very fun

JONKKKK#4186
because JEEZ

Toaster#2600
ever
like grinding in any gam sucxs

JONKKKK#4186
its not like *grind for three hours and get one thing*
its
*explore stuff, pick stuff up, and* ***then*** *get one thing*

Toaster#2600
its like *grind for half an hour and get one thing but then oh no you need four of those things to build the full thing better go out and get some more*

JONKKKK#4186
uhhh
no..?
besides like
the neptune escape rocket
nothing is ever more than one part
and no items take half an hour to get

Toaster#2600
that doesnt mean its enjoyable

JONKKKK#4186
most of your time "grinding" is spent travelling
hol up
gay
i havent watched this
but I BET
its positive

Toaster#2600
uh
okay?
I dont really care if IGN rated a game positive?
at all?

JONKKKK#4186
just
WATCH IT

Toaster#2600
no

JONKKKK#4186
k

Toaster#2600
I have found a map I enjoy a lot because it looks nice and its also really open so you can bhop like hell and its gret

Toaster#2600
oh also I know commands that make cs easier for ppl like yoo so you mite hav sum fun

JONKKKK#4186
no thats not it
csgo is just
repetitive

Toaster#2600
too hard
literally any game is repetetive

JONKKKK#4186
but
its basically the same thing over and over
"1v1 me"
"lets play comp"

Toaster#2600
uhmmmmmm how bout any other game?
splatoon
"lets play a game"
"lets do hide and seek"
you can say that stuff about any game

JONKKKK#4186
i guess
but thats why you take breaks

Toaster#2600
uh
no

JONKKKK#4186
but cs is literally all you play

Toaster#2600
sure sometimes you take breaks
THATS BECAUSE ITS THE ONLY GAME I CAN PLAY WITHOUT FRIENDS THAT IS SEMI INTERESTING
if you actually PLAYED with me id probably play plenty more than cs
you are complaining about me doing something because you wont play with me and then also not playing with me
you still alive or did you dissolve into dumb youtube vids

JONKKKK#4186
ding ding ding!
corrrecttttt!
you winnnnnnn
uhh

Toaster#2600

JONKKKK#4186
ok
i can see how *that* might be fun

Toaster#2600
exactly
like even with the game at half or even a fourth speed its still pretty hard to hit

JONKKKK#4186

Toaster#2600
SPEAKING OF WHICH itd be fun to do a fourth speed 1v1 but you prob dont wanna

JONKKKK#4186

Toaster#2600

why do you only like games that arent fun

JONKKKK#4186
why do you only like csgo

Toaster#2600
uhm
i dont

JONKKKK#4186
well
you know what i mean
you only play action games and think all other games are garbage

Toaster#2600
here lets see all the other games I like that I would probably play more if you actually felt like spending time like friends

JONKKKK#4186
also
nats over
and hes kinda just playing oxygen not included
and if you wanna play with people we could totally all play a game that isnt csgo (nate)
so shut

Toaster#2600
-GRIP
-Brawlhalla
-PAC-MAN (competetive leaderboard :p)
-ROR
-Shellshock
-Speedrunners
-Astroneer (though it gets boring fast)
-Duck Game
-Gmod (I guess its sorta your comps fault but you could actually do a small thing called TROUBLESHOOTING instead of just saying 'okay bye' and leaving me and nate to call you a cunt)
-GWYF
-MoD
-Starbound
-Terraria (sorta like astroneer tho)
ANY of those are things we could play
yeah but nate
the problem is either
-jonathan doesnt want to play
-jonathan tries the game and something breaks so he gives up
sooooo

JONKKKK#4186
i tried to fix gmod

Toaster#2600
I literally just google it
and in like five seconds
gay
did you try that jonathan?
hm?

JONKKKK#4186
but then you guys would have to get rid of your addons

Toaster#2600
noo?

JONKKKK#4186
??
idec what they mean

Toaster#2600
did you install any new addons between you being able to walk and you not
because just off the top of my head I can think of plenty of things that might fix it that you probably didnt do
also one sec Ill brb and thenn ill call you out on bein dumb some more
you still here or did you just switch back to oxygen lol

JONKKKK#4186
2 monitors you idiot
(nat)

Toaster#2600
i fucking know you cuck
I mean did you switch back to oxygen and then just stop listening to me because you knew I was right
fuck off nate

JONKKKK#4186
no
and btw it happened because i accidentally pressed a thing
it made a noise
then i couldnt walk

Toaster#2600
then try some stuff
could you walk normally at first?

JONKKKK#4186
ye

Toaster#2600
then couple a things
-you need a new keyboard goddamnit
-maybe dont smash your keyboard when you get into a game
stop leaving

JONKKKK#4186
no i dont need a new keyboard lol
it works fine

Toaster#2600
yeah you do
the alt key is dead and if you press a key that you dont know then it breaks games
*i think you need a new keyboard*

JONKKKK#4186
besides the alt key, its fine

Toaster#2600
unless you can figure out that key and/or fix it then uh no
you sorta need a new keyboard

JONKKKK#4186
and the key that i pressed was near wasd and shift and stuff

Toaster#2600
*there is no key over there that breaks games*
*get a new keyboard*

JONKKKK#4186
I KNOW
THATS WHY IM CONFUSED
AND ITS ***NOT*** MY KEYBOARD

Toaster#2600
yeah it sorta is

JONKKKK#4186
no..?

Toaster#2600
either that or a gay progran you have installde

JONKKKK#4186
???????
but idk what it is
imma just

Toaster#2600
i think you just need a new keyboard
because only your keyboard does that

JONKKKK#4186
dude
if you brought your keyboard over and did it, 100% sure it would stay
if it was a key, it would probably fix on relaunch

Toaster#2600
mmmmmmm nope

JONKKKK#4186
and even so, I have the same keys you have

Toaster#2600
so then its a gay program you have or something

JONKKKK#4186
no..?

Toaster#2600
that or you have some keybind thats fucked up as hell

JONKKKK#4186
no....?????

Toaster#2600
those are literally the only possibilities

JONKKKK#4186
or...
its NOT my keyboard

Toaster#2600
I just listed two other possibilities jonathan
can you read

JONKKKK#4186
ugh
k im out
youre doin me a salt

Toaster#2600
you mad
but seriously like

JONKKKK#4186
youre actually impossible to argue with
bye

Toaster#2600
those are the only possibilities
jonathan you cuck
im impossible to argue with because *im fucking right about this*
its hard to argue with someone when youre wrong
just sayin
*can I just point out that you quit an entire chat service because I was trying to tell you how to fix your game*
for whenever you get back on, do these things in this order, launching the game in between/when it says in each step;
-Launch game, press every key near WASD until you get that 'sound' and your movement breaks. congrats, if you found it, dont press that key anymore.
-Go to game properties and validate local files
-Go to in-game console and type 'unbindall' and then rebind all the keys you need in settings.
-Uninstall ALL addons (dont DELETE em, just uninstall em. (keep em on your comp, so you can reinstall later))
-IF previous fixed walking thing, go through all addons and install them one by one until your walking breaks again. Congrats, if you found it, dont use that addon.
-Reinstall game
-Get a new keyboard

JONKKKK#4186
k i reinstalled gmod and now it wont launch

Toaster#2600
whyd you reinstall it
that was like the second to last thing I reccomended

JONKKKK#4186
to see if it would fix it
idk

Toaster#2600
did it launch
it says youre playing it

JONKKKK#4186
nope
tries to "fetch subscriptions"
stops at 50
stops responding

Toaster#2600
go to the workshop and uninstall every addon

JONKKKK#4186

Toaster#2600
o ew

JONKKKK#4186
no u

Toaster#2600
no u

JONKKKK#4186
OH NO

Toaster#2600
i might do effects of under/oversleepin
cuz i do both lmaaaaooooo

JONKKKK#4186
nice lol

Toaster#2600
laughing my ass ass ass ass ass ass off off off off off off off off
which shud i du
over or under

JONKKKK#4186
both

Toaster#2600
but is suppoed to be one
what would i do for both
like compare/contrast both

JONKKKK#4186
ok so i have:
What effects do video games have on the brain?
Pros: Improve attention, visuospatial skills (ability to identify visual and spatial relationships between objects), and memory. Also possible treatment for depression and
Cons: Addictive, alterations in reward systems, symptoms of other addicts.


How much is too much?
A study finds that an hour or less a day is good, 1-3 hours a day is okay, but 3+ hours a day and it starts to have negative effects.
What about VR?
In mice, at least, their brains acted in similar ways to real life when they returned to a specific location.
It can help people control their dreams
It can cause some strange side effects like seeing ‚Äúdepth‚Äù in the darkness when you close your eyes, black dots and headaches after using it, vertigo, and symptoms of being drunk
What effects do different kinds of video games have on the brain?
Which is the best?
Which is the worst?
First person action games, as they can actually shrink your brain.
Strategy games may provide protection against dementia and alzheimer's disease
FPS‚Äôs caused shrinkage in hippocampus
BUT, it depends on how you play. If you memorize ‚Äúright, left, left, right, up, left...‚Äù then it shrinks. If you memorize the terrain, then it will increase the gray matter in your brain.
Mario games had the opposite effect
Anything besides first person action games caused growth.
So, is it good or bad to play video games? (conclusion)
thats what i used for research

Toaster#2600
im just gonna do like what I do for history notes for research notes

JONKKKK#4186
so you should ask questions like "what are the effects of oversleeping?, what are the effects of undersleeping?, what are the benifits of getting the right amount of sleep?, what amount of sleep should I get?"
like
i have

Toaster#2600
yeyeyeye but I still wanna do only one

JONKKKK#4186

that could be pages lol

Toaster#2600
jonk thats not the question

JONKKKK#4186
dude you should do both

Toaster#2600
the question is oh
but then what
like
compare/contrast both

JONKKKK#4186
yea

Toaster#2600
kkk

JONKKKK#4186
that should be like 2 pgphs
and then you need 3 more body paragraphs
then an intro and conclusion
bam!

Toaster#2600
ye ik you heck

JONKKKK#4186
you got yourself a report

Toaster#2600
see I told you it was easy lol

JONKKKK#4186

Undersleeping

gay

-In the short term, affects judgement, mood, ability to retain information or learn, and may increase the risk of accidents or injury.
-In the long term, it can lead to many effects such as obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and early death.
-Definitely takes a toll on perception and judgement, and it can be seen in reduced efficiency and errors or accidents.
-There can be deadly side effects, like car crashed from driving while tired.


gay

-Doctors at the Royal Mental Health Centre have shown that less than six hours of sleep at night can cause impairment similar to a blood alcohol level of 0.05 percent. (Similar to one or two drinks for most adults.)
-Most who sleep less tend to eat more as well, correlating with obesity.
-Recommended 7-8 hours of sleep a night for adults.

JONK - Today at 5:21 PM

Zildin - Today at 5:22 PM
Error. Target is too pissed off to do the simple things. Please try again later.
Plus you wont do something simple for me. Getting a pissed off person to help you in this situtation will be tough.
JONK - Today at 5:24 PM

Zildin - Today at 5:26 PM
Ok fine. Ive had a shit day. I have assholes in almost every damn class and they have been piling on top of my level of tolerance and that bar has fucking shattered. So when i come home, i expect to be able to rebuild, but NOPE! More assholes being assholes, destroying what litle tolerance i have left.

*it was literally just me and liam messing around*

JONKKKK#4186
yea lol
i changed it to make him feel better tho

Toaster#2600
*would he prefer that I actually name him something bad so that he has an actual reason to be salty?*
fixxd
gay

JONKKKK#4186
dude dont
thats a dick move

Toaster#2600
hes calling me an asshole for doing something that
-barely affected him
-will actually never matter ever
-did I mention itll never matter
-he is extremely salty about it for no reason
hes like
nate times 15 right now

JONKKKK#4186
yea but doing something you know will make them sad is just mean

Toaster#2600
*but it shouldnt make him sad*

JONKKKK#4186
i know but still

Toaster#2600
its like me calling someone else a nickname
and then HIM getting salty about it
even though literally no one else ever cared or will care
its him getting sad about something thatll never affect him in any way

JONKKKK#4186
i know its dumb
but that doesnt mean you can do it

Toaster#2600
that doesnt mean he can be salty about it
tell him to stop being a bitch about everything

JONKKKK#4186
connor did something to my discord
and he wont tell me what

Toaster#2600
lmao what

JONKKKK#4186
dont
tell him i sent it to you lol
hes already salty already
sent that he did something

Toaster#2600
oh like remotely
he probably cant do everything

JONKKKK#4186

Toaster#2600

What if we all had our own specific servers but they all had different uses for things
like you owned a server, as well as me/nate/liam/whoever

something like that

Toaster#2600

JONKKKK#4186

Toaster#2600
*start enjoying csgo*
nah jk lol

JONKKKK#4186
***oh hey i enjoy csgo now wanna play***

Toaster#2600
___***yes***___
i wish lol

JONKKKK#4186
ehh
doesnt seem that fun
they werent even laughing at csgo

Toaster#2600
ik but I feel like csgo is a great game to have moments like that because of in-game chat as well as just
oh okay also
technically they were
because in most other games you canst just change your name on the go like that

JONKKKK#4186
i guessssss

Toaster#2600
sure you can change your steam name but it wont update ingame that fast
idk I feel like csgo is just a breeding ground of funny moments

JONKKKK#4186
meb

Toaster#2600
brawl is more a breeding ground of yelling and nate being salty

JONKKKK#4186
((which is pretty funny))

Toaster#2600
not that thats bad
yeah
its still entertaining
but not *as* entertaining lol

JONKKKK#4186
yea
i gess

Toaster#2600
idk
I feel like if you put time into cs and got better youd enjoy it
ik you dont wanna but
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
its not like youd have to work that hard to get to where I am lol
im still pretty trash

JONKKKK#4186
i kinda suck at games lol
not the best

Toaster#2600
I think its sorta just cuz you never put a ton of time into one game
you just switch games a lot

JONKKKK#4186
i ges

Toaster#2600
like okay
its not like I enjoy playing CSGO always
sometimes its more 'I have nothing to do, and my aim is trash, im just gonna pull up a youtube vid or music or something and an aim practice map and do that for a half an hour'
its not always entertaining

JONKKKK#4186
yea
thats the problem

Toaster#2600
heh
push through lol
just turn on autoplay or something and put on professor stick and practice aim or something
even just practicing against bots help
s
idk

JONKKKK#4186
yea lol

Toaster#2600
but you do kinda admit that if you were better at cs youd enjoy it more rite

JONKKKK#4186
ehhhhhh

JONKKKK#4186

I thought this was supposed to be hard or something
Effects of undersleeping usually fall into roughly two categories, short term and long term. Short term effects include things such as affecting judgement, mood, ability to retain information or learn correctly, and may increase the risk of accidents or injuries, such as getting in a car crash while driving and being tired. In the long term, undersleeping can lead to many effects such as obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, or early death. Not getting enough sleep certainly takes a tool on perception and judgement, and it can be seen in reduced efficiency and errors or accidents in work.[1] Doctors at the Royal Mental Health Centre have shown that less than six hours of sleep at night can cause impairment similar to a blood alcohol level of 0.05%, which is similar to one or two drinks for most adults. Most who sleep less tend to eat more as well, correlating with obesity.[2] A 1997 National Sleep Foundation poll estimated that 1.8 billion dollars in work productivity were lost to sleep disorders and sleep debt that year. There are also things like ‚ÄúChronic sleep debt‚Äù, which is defined as the hours you fell short of within the eight-hour sleep, that gets accumulated over time. Basically, if you spend five days a week, getting only seven hours of sleep each day, at the end of the five days you have a sleep debt of 5 hours.[3]

ive already done everything but the intro paragraph and bibliography
I guess I could make the conclusion a bit longer but still

can you help with the intro paragraph
im bad at it
all I have is "    This paper will explain potential health hazards of undersleeping and oversleeping, and compare and contrast both. " and thats it
@JONKKKK#4186

JONKKKK#4186
uhh
Many people think video games rot your brain. Others think that they‚Äôre good for you. So, what‚Äôs the answer? That's what this report will answer: whether the effects are good, bad, or a little bit of both.

Toaster#2600
lmao so I wrote my crime story and when I got to the end I just realized "whOOPS I forgot the salt" sooooooooooooooooo
Once, there was a man sitting innocently in his home. He was working on a computer, one of his best ones yet. A man walks in wielding a handgun, and point it at him. The man working on the computer instinctively holds up a black plastic tray to defend himself, but the man with the handgun shoots it and it shatters. He looks around for something else to defend himself with, and noticies a roll of tape. He breaks off a small piece, and tapes over the man‚Äôs gun. Miraculously, it jams the gun, but some ball bearings fall out and onto the floor. The man who was working on his computer slips, but still attempts to protect his creation. The man with the broken handgun says, ‚ÄúFine, if you won‚Äôt let me take the computer, ill just break it!‚Äù. He takes out wire cutters, and to the man‚Äôs horror, clips all the wires of the computer. The robber then leaves the house, and the man with the computer cries all by his lonesome. Then, he stress ate a crazy amount of salt for no reason.

My bird died first year of college, i wasn't even home
My family thought i didn't need to know
Over break i arrived to an empty cage
A cage that had been occupied since the seventh grade
A grey cockatiel with cheeks like pikachu
Spikey was his name, had this real nice whistle too
Kept in him the living room until the day he nearly flew
Right into the ceiling fan, clipped his wings that day
In my old songs, you can hear him singing in the back
Matter fact, he's the first I ever featured on a track
I would get home from school and just tell him bout my day
As he perched on my shoulder, nibbling on my frames
Should've taken better care of him, it really wasn't fair to him
I got too caught up in things and hardly was i there for him
In his final days he would sit at the bottom of his cage
I just wish i could erase the guilt, let it wash away

JONKKKK#4186
i wrote this in a predictive text story maker
Harry potter and the Confederation Pies
The great hall was starting to attract harry and ron, but ron shook his head vigorously at harry over and over again. Harry felt a surge of fury that was quite suddenly gone in an instant. Ron said nothing but hermione seized his wand and pointed it at the ceiling above them. They all seemed to be struggling to bring harry away from dumbledore. Dumbledore turned to harry and pensively said to ron as though he was on top of a nearby tree " harry was sure he was scared. " his wand raised and harry saw a gigantic dragon was rearing in harry‚Äôs wig. Hermione looked up eagerly from behind dumbledore‚Äôs situation, and then she spoke: it was too late ‚Äî it seemed that the death eaters were standing in their own mouth. Harry began to feed hermione with his spindly fingers clenched on her nose. He looked up into dumbledore‚Äôs splintering cup with tears streaming down into snape‚Äôs snape. He said loudly that lupin nearly dropped his photograph album. Ron muttered to mrs. Harry and ron joined her face from under the stairs. Harry saw his mouth hanging upside down in midair as though it were a couple of minutes from hogwarts. Harry had the feeling of a magazine entitled to see what was going on. " Confederation pies, " harry said. There was nobody there.

Toaster#2600
I don't understand what you're saying about csgo
"I don't like it because there's ingame money that you use to buy weapons every round and without that it's unbalanced"
Except
-it's still balanced without the money
-take a core mechanic out of literally any game and it becomes unbalanced
At least you don't have to spend real money just to get the weapons you want in game
OR even if you ignore that, you're basically saying that you dislike csgo because it requires strategy and planning
Which R6 has too
Your point is kinda very rart

JONKKKK#4186
well the thing is
AWPs are better than SSGs in basically every way (besides money)
and I dont like it

Toaster#2600
why?
SSG's are good alternatives to AWP's if youre short on money

JONKKKK#4186
my favorite thing when playing games is choosing what weapons you like most
BUT

Toaster#2600
also, the SSG has one advantage over pretty much every weapon
and in CSGO you CAN choose whatever weapon you want

JONKKKK#4186
in csgo, you cant do that because most weapons are 'bad'

Toaster#2600
what

JONKKKK#4186
theyre worse than others
you're putting yourself at a disadvantage by using them
and i dont really like that

Toaster#2600
there are advantages and disadvantages to every weapon
theres at least one 'good' weapon of every type

JONKKKK#4186
ugh whatever

Toaster#2600
im trying to debate this
its sorta annoying that you just say whatever

JONKKKK#4186
youre right, im wrong

Toaster#2600
I want to know why you dislike CSGO

JONKKKK#4186
you win
I SAID WHY

Toaster#2600
you say you dislike it because of this, but this doesnt exist
tell me why you dislike it

JONKKKK#4186
say, if I like the MP9, using it late game means I'll probably lose

Toaster#2600
not necesarrily

JONKKKK#4186
you can't adjust to your playstyle that well

Toaster#2600
maps are set up so there are close quarters and long hallways
if you know where to go and how to use the gun you can do well with it

JONKKKK#4186
yes, but you even said "the MP7 is better than the MP9"
but I like the MP9 more

Toaster#2600
it is, it has overall better stats
why?

JONKKKK#4186
and it sucks that I cant use it

JONKKKK#4186
k

Toaster#2600
im editing my outro

JONKKKK#4186
oh

Toaster#2600
its slow going lol
there's so much camera shake and fx and stuff its really hard to scrub through but also takes forever to render lmao

JONKKKK#4186
hah

Toaster#2600
and literally all it is is just my logo, the two video blocks (where the videos go in the outro), a background (which is just an image), and a purple background so I can see stuff
and then the audio
but thats IT and its giving my comp a hard time
gay
Oh man it's 0.01% done remdering
0.07
Ok now it's speeding up lol
did you finish your outro?

JONKKKK#4186
uh
ye

Toaster#2600
you should mak another one
idk why and maybe its just me but making outros is fun lol

JONKKKK#4186
nah lol
i like mine

Toaster#2600
no i know, I like mine too but if you use the same outro every video it gets sorta old
like I find the one I use stale and I used it for only 3 videos lol
or you could alternate two or three of em
thats probably what ill end up doing
You should

JONKKKK#4186
meb

Toaster#2600
You know what would maybe make a good outro
Or intro now that I think about it

JONKKKK#4186
hm
also ew intros

Toaster#2600
For the intro just make your logo pop up in the center of the screen, and make a version of it with the beak open, and then just get a chirp sound and play it right when it hits maximum size and change it to the open- okay this is a really bad way of explaining it
It pops up, chirps, and then falls back down

JONKKKK#4186
hah
klol

Toaster#2600
And then for the outro just that except instead of falling into oblivion it falls into place on the end screen
Also rendering my outro crashed my computer lmao

JONKKKK#4186
add deja vu onto your sound board

JONKKKK#4186
dude you know how youre not using chrome any more
well i discovered vivaldi and you can put your tabs on the FREAKING SIDE

Toaster#2600
yeah but i didnt export the vid

JONKKKK#4186
klol

JONKKKK#4186
hey toaster apparently we both bought the "starter edition" of r6 for $15 instead of the "standard edition" for $40 which means operators ar esuper expensive
(usually they cost ~1000 renown)

Toaster#2600
ok so its even worse

JONKKKK#4186
nah

Toaster#2600
yeah pretty much

JONKKKK#4186
the total for buying them all with real muns comes out to about the same amount

Toaster#2600
"hey, spend the normal amount of money for a game and have to put in way more effort for something mediocre, or spend way more money just so getting them is easier!"

JONKKKK#4186
they couldve just released the game for $40

Toaster#2600
kinda a scumbag marketing tactic

JONKKKK#4186
no, $15 is discount

Toaster#2600
its like xbox live where you have to pay to play online

JONKKKK#4186
its more like

Toaster#2600
like fuck off
also p sure i just ran into your strip mine on MC

JONKKKK#4186
"hey, you can buy the game at full price, or you can buy it for less but operators are more expensive."

Toaster#2600
thats still a scumbag move

JONKKKK#4186
eh

Toaster#2600
thats BASICALLY saying its PTW
pay more money and get more operators

JONKKKK#4186
not really

Toaster#2600
yeah it is lmao

JONKKKK#4186
operators are decently balanced
its not like

Toaster#2600
but you get the point

JONKKKK#4186
"pay money to get better gear!"
its

Toaster#2600
its
"pay money to get the gear you want"

JONKKKK#4186
"pay money to get *different* gear!"
i agree, it sucks
BUT
r6 for $15
worth

JONKKKK#4186

JONKKKK#4186
Oh lol
And what's that one?

Toaster#2600
what
extraverted, intuitive, feeling, prospecting, turbulent

JONKKKK#4186
Like ENTP is the debator

Toaster#2600
the campaigner

JONKKKK#4186
Oh
Klol
Does it sound like you

Toaster#2600
i guess

JONKKKK#4186
Send me like a paragraph from it

Toaster#2600
i already closed it

JONKKKK#4186
Oh
Can you give me the jist
Like

Toaster#2600
uhm
idk

JONKKKK#4186
It says that I like to argue and come up with ideas and be creative
And self improve

Toaster#2600
for someone who likes arguing you arent very good at it
*for someone who likes to come up with ideas you dont have very good ones*
nah lol

JONKKKK#4186
And that sounds EXACTLY like you
Right?

Toaster#2600
sure
idk why it said that about you it honestly doesnt sound very accurate

JONKKKK#4186
I mean
I didn't realize it but I do argue a good amount

Toaster#2600
maybe its just me but i think of liking arguing and being good at it kinds go hand in hand
like
why would you enjoy arguing if you were wrong
or bad at it

JONKKKK#4186
Eh
I might be bad at it but that doesn't mean I don't like it
Like see
We're arguing right now

Toaster#2600
yeah i get that
but why would you *enjoy* arguing if you werent good at it

JONKKKK#4186
Eh
It's more
I enjoy it but I'm bad at it
Like
You're bad at csgo

Toaster#2600
I can understand enjoying video games while being bad at em
like yeah
but arguing

JONKKKK#4186
I don't do it intentionally
It just happens

Toaster#2600
again, maybe just me

JONKKKK#4186
Also I'm kinda in between the e/I so

Toaster#2600
still doesnt seem like the most accurate thing ever

JONKKKK#4186
I'm not totally the debator

Toaster#2600
m

Toaster#2600

JONKKKK#4186
nah

Toaster#2600
ok but actually whyd you get so salty about that lmao
@JONKKKK#4186

JONKKKK#4186
dude
it was funny at first but it just got annoying

Toaster#2600
i did it *twice*

JONKKKK#4186
3 times

Toaster#2600
twice lma
o
oh no youre right because R6 doesnt understand the concept of overtime
still, thats not that bad
plus you immediately switched from "lmao ok stop" to "uninstall cs" in like no time at all
calm down lol its just a game
@JONKKKK#4186 you alive

JONKKKK#4186
yeah
sorry was in a game

Toaster#2600
but actually whyd you get so salty all the sudden

JONKKKK#4186
eh
idk

Toaster#2600
I mean it was funny but why lol
itll make for a good vid i can tell you that

JONKKKK#4186
you were being a dick

Toaster#2600
its just a game though
and what i was doing wasnt even that bad

JONKKKK#4186
dude
without his yokai, echo is useless
you *basically* teamkilled me

Toaster#2600
except to
you know
play

JONKKKK#4186
?

Toaster#2600
yknow
play
like a normal person

JONKKKK#4186
echo has super weak guns, is slow, and useless without the yokai
soooooo

Toaster#2600
again
play

JONKKKK#4186
its not like normal drones

Toaster#2600
like a normal person

JONKKKK#4186
its like killing twitches drones

Toaster#2600
and *again again*
you didnt need to get so salty about it
its just a game like calm down
you coulda just messed around with me too
not my fault you got extremely salty and just uninstalled cs
oh also you KNOw we had fun doing wingman lol

JONKKKK#4186
ill reinstall if you do

Toaster#2600
probably tonight
im not reinstalling right now lol its like 70 gb
for each
i guess i dont need to install the tts but still
70 gb
im doing that overnight lol
if you wanna reinstall im practicing normal bhops in a friends match if you wanna join

JONKKKK#4186
the thing is with the wingman
we werent having fun doing the wingman
we were having fun *talking*

Toaster#2600
I was for 90% of it
then my internet died
also the thing about that is
stuff that happens in the game is what prompts us to talk about things

JONKKKK#4186
i gues
ss
ssssssss
but that could happen with r6 too

Toaster#2600
like just getting in a normal call and talking probably wouldnt lead to any, or at least not as many funny things
yeah i know you getting way overly salty at your drones dying was really funny
but R6 is a lot more
"haha this funny thing happened in-game" instead of
"haha this funny thing just got said because of something that happened in-game"

JONKKKK#4186
i guess
wanna call?

Toaster#2600

i feel like you might have more fun with r6 if you put time into it

Toaster#2600
what no

JONKKKK#4186
and also when i hit lvl 20 we should do ranked

Toaster#2600
id have more fun with R6 if you didnt freak out every time i mildly inconvenienced you

JONKKKK#4186
okay i would argue with you rn but i know that ittl just go in circles with your only argument being "you're wrong"

Toaster#2600
thats just cuz you know im right

JONKKKK#4186
well yeah but imagine if a teamate shot rook's armor as soon as he put it down

Toaster#2600
ive had that happen to me

JONKKKK#4186
was it annoying?

Toaster#2600
not too much lol
it wasnt funny but it wasnt annoying
its funny when youre in a call wiht someone

JONKKKK#4186
i guess

Toaster#2600
and you are intentionally annoying them
and it is funny

JONKKKK#4186
Toaster - Today at 4:59 PM
id have more fun with R6 if you didnt freak out every time i mildly inconvenienced you

Toaster#2600
exactly

JONKKKK#4186
you admit that it was funny
and yeah, i overreacted

Toaster#2600
yeah it WAS funny
but you just went "ah no you got rid of my drones now im useless its not like I could help watch the stairs or anything like that hah not i dont have drones and now i should just uninstall games also fuck you toaster now im useless even though im pretty useless always because i succ"

JONKKKK#4186
yeah, i said i admit i overreacted

Toaster#2600
the overreaction made it funnier as well but you uninstall games ill uninstall as well

JONKKKK#4186
yeah i shouldnt have uninstalled

JONKKKK#4186
Hey why's your name Diblet in toasters place

Toaster#2600
because

JONKKKK#4186
Klol
Hey I'm a Time traveller it's 7:09 rn
Wait when did you wake up

Toaster#2600
today

JONKKKK#4186
:0000
But yeah i woke up at like 10:20 your time

Toaster#2600
hey wanna do something

JONKKKK#4186
wait did you install r6 yet

Toaster#2600
no because it had to do like 70 updates

JONKKKK#4186
oof
well doooo

Toaster#2600
ive been consistently downloading it and its not done just because its so big
also no lol
do you want to do something
hey you should stop leaving in the middle of conversations

JONKKKK#4186
oh oop sorry

Toaster#2600
we should do something
surf, shellshocc, gwyf
i sorta feel like gwyf
*HEY YOU SHOULD STOP LEAVING IN THE MIDDLE OF CONVERSATIONS*

JONKKKK#4186
eh
i kinda just wanna chill for now

Toaster#2600
get oofed
i *actually* top fragged in cs lol

JONKKKK#4186
i top fragged in r6 a bit ago
also are you reinstalling

Toaster#2600
No I forgot
I prob wouldn't play anyways lol

JONKKKK#4186
dooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
i mean
we have fun with terrorist hunt

Toaster#2600
Nah I'll install it but I doubt I'll actually play it
I've been having fun with csgo comp
Even solo queue
P fun times
Plus I do semi-well most of the time
I guess since I did a ton of wingman I sorta got better and am just now doing comp again
I did derank from lack of playtime tho and I'm sad

JONKKKK#4186
im having fun with r6 comp
just got to lvl 20

Toaster#2600
Congrats
r6 comp just seems like it'd be full of tryhards
Because casual is essentially just the same thing without ranks
Casual in csgo is like a whole different gamemode

JONKKKK#4186
actually p fun

Toaster#2600
You do you I guess

JONKKKK#4186
well i mean
its the most fun when you have other ppl with you

Toaster#2600
What

JONKKKK#4186
so when you install it we should at least try one game of ranked

Toaster#2600
No lol
As I said it's literally just casual with ranks I'm not missing out on anything by not doing it

JONKKKK#4186
but its more fun
because there are actual stakes to it

Toaster#2600
Playing casual is probably more fun since you can actually mess around without people shit talking you

JONKKKK#4186
i guess

Toaster#2600
There aren't any more stakes than in casual
Other than the rank, which isn't stakes unless you have trash teammates

JONKKKK#4186
i mean its not like there are stakes in cs

Toaster#2600
If you have a good team, play well, and have a good game, but lose your rank, that's not losing anything
It just means you aren't as good as you thought you were
Hey you should stop leaving in the middle of conversations

JONKKKK#4186
sotty
sorry*
i was playing a game
but yeah its not like cs has stakes

Toaster#2600
That's not my point

JONKKKK#4186
but ranked is just more fun if you wanna take r6 seriously

Toaster#2600
There's no other gamemode on CSGO that is exactly like competitive except without ranks

JONKKKK#4186
not as many disconnects, less tachanka mains, so on and so forth

Toaster#2600
And that's all that comp in r6 is, a duplicate of casual with ranks
Also it's tchanka

JONKKKK#4186
wait but how is casual *that* different from comp?

Toaster#2600
Casual:
15v15

Comp:
5v5
Do I really need to say more

JONKKKK#4186
no its tachanka
gay

Toaster#2600
Hm I always thot it was tchanka

JONKKKK#4186
nup
but still
what dont you like about r6

Toaster#2600
What don't you like about csgo

JONKKKK#4186
i mean
csgo is kinda fun
just

Toaster#2600
I mean
R6 is kinda fun
Just

JONKKKK#4186
csgo is too fast paced
i like slower paced games
like

Toaster#2600
R6 is too slow paced
I like faster paced games
Like

JONKKKK#4186
wingman is better, but yeah
so we actually found out the reasons why we dont like each game
also, r6 is a bit more tactical and based less on muscle memory

Toaster#2600
I guess but I was more just showing you that whatever you say about cs I can say the opposite for r6 and it still makes sense

JONKKKK#4186
yeah

Toaster#2600
Ask csgo is a bit more tactical and based less on muscle memory
Also*

JONKKKK#4186
how?

Toaster#2600
Wait for me to get home to my computer typing on a phone is ass

JONKKKK#4186
when will that be?

Toaster#2600
In just a bit

JONKKKK#4186
k

Toaster#2600
hi i have achieved comp
also sure csgo has muscle memory, but every game does. Try to name a game that DOESNT use at least a small amount of muscle memory. CSGO is pretty damn tactical, and while, sure, it's in different areas than R6, it's still pretty high up there. There are reasons it's an esport and has lots of competitions n stuff.

JONKKKK#4186
well
it doesnt even have destructable surfaces

Toaster#2600
sure, (i will admit that that is something I enjoy about R6) but that doesnt mean its not super tactical.

JONKKKK#4186
what ways is it tactical (ik there are some, just curious what)

Toaster#2600
man youre making me pause my video to actually pay attention to what im typing youre so mean
but yeah one sec lemme type this out
-knowing when to peek, when not to
-knowing when to rotate
-knowing nade spots
-knowing when to nade and (sorta the same as nade spots but) where
-knowing when to defuse/plant
-knowing when to walk, run, crouch, etc
-knowing stack spots and where to peek
-im too lazy to list more i want to go back to my youtube vid kthx

JONKKKK#4186
r6 has all of those

Toaster#2600
lemme make another list (dang youre making me pause my vid alot lol)
-r6 doesnt have peeking (not in the same way as CS)
-r6 doesnt have rotating
-r6 doesnt have nade spots
-r6 doesnt really have nades in general, they arent super commonly used
-r6 (while having defusing) doesnt have planting and also, how often have you seen a round won by a defuse instead of a dead team?
-r6 does have walking/crouching (not jumping tho lol)
-r6 doesnt have stack spots (you cant even stack)
-r6 sorta has peek spots? Its not like in CS where there are set spots you know to peek because the map is more dynamic, so its less "nobody in (specific spot), nobody in (other specific spot)" and more "okay nobody there or there"

JONKKKK#4186
r6 has peeking, its just kind of different

Toaster#2600
thats what i said

JONKKKK#4186
also whats rotating again?

Toaster#2600
rotating bomb sites

JONKKKK#4186
r6 has that

Toaster#2600
no it doesnt lol

JONKKKK#4186
uh
yeah it does

Toaster#2600
the bomb sites are almost always right next to each other
no it fucking doesnt

JONKKKK#4186
i mean
theyre usually blocked off, but i see your point

Toaster#2600
yeah it really doesnt have rotating

JONKKKK#4186
and nades are really useful in r6 but again, i see what you mean
r6 doesnt have jumping, but it has: running, walking, slow walking, crouching, and proning

Toaster#2600
yeah i know
that was literally the one point where I said "yeah youre pretty much right"

JONKKKK#4186
but i realized why i like r6 so much better
in r6, information is super important

Toaster#2600
in csgo, information is super important

JONKKKK#4186
no but if you know where someone is, you can peek them and one tap them immediately
no matter what

Toaster#2600
not really

JONKKKK#4186
yeah

Toaster#2600
you have to know
-are they crouching
-did they move
-are you aiming at head level
-if you miss, can you control recoil
its EASIER to get one taps in R6 than csgo

JONKKKK#4186
yeah
i guess

Toaster#2600
anything else for me to super debunk 100% fake totally exposed diss track coming out tomorrow

JONKKKK#4186
lmao
but yeah
in r6 youve gotta know
what operators they have
common spawnpeeks
how to use your gadget to the fullest
optimal routes to the sites
where people commonly enter
where to reinforce
and plenty of other things

Toaster#2600
also fun fact gravity is supposed to pull everything to the bottom of the earth right but except wait no it doesnt because if it did where would all the water be? at the bottom. there wouldnt be water anywhere. but what do you know, we have water so flat earth 100% confirmed

JONKKKK#4186
what

Toaster#2600
in csgo you ALSO have to know ontimal routs to the sites, where people commonly enter, where to reinforce (like stack and watch, not physically barricade) and 'plenty of other things'

JONKKKK#4186
whats stacking

Toaster#2600
gay

JONKKKK#4186
yeah thats what i thought
but i mean
in cs there are only like 3 places where ppl will enter

Toaster#2600
so you have to communicate with your team, and if you only have 2 people on site then the two of you have to watch all three
and the maps in CS are a lot more open instead of all closed and inside so its more difficult aswell

JONKKKK#4186
yeah but if you only have 2 on site you gotta watch EVERYWHERE in r6

Toaster#2600
not really
find a place where you can easily watch one spot (preferably common but doesnt really matter) and cant easily be spotted
watch that place until someone either come in through there or come in through somewhere else, in which case you move and watch there

JONKKKK#4186
okay, one thing that makes it harder:
theres more than one ct spawn

Toaster#2600
there isnt
everyone spawns in the same place

JONKKKK#4186
no

Toaster#2600
yeah, everyone spawns in a group lol

JONKKKK#4186
in ranked you choose ***independantly*** where you spawn

Toaster#2600
you know what counters that?

JONKKKK#4186
hm

Toaster#2600
you choose where you want the bomb/hostage to be on t side
wwhoaaawwww
crazy

JONKKKK#4186
how does that counter..?

Toaster#2600
ct doesnt know where bomb is
t doesnt know where ct spawn is
unless they know how to use drones

JONKKKK#4186
ct knows where bomb is if theyre competent

Toaster#2600
and even then, doesnt matter where they spawn because as i said
they enter into one of two bombsites (usually literally right next to each other ant not barricaded/mostly not if your team is slightly competent) and it doesnt matter where they spawn
most bombsites only have a couple enterances, and there are a COUPLE that have too many windows but most of em dont

JONKKKK#4186
well ok

Toaster#2600
___***hey you should stop leaving in the middle of conversations***___

JONKKKK#4186
so we've established r6 is just as hard as cs, just in different ways

Toaster#2600
it was more
you saying "r6 is more tactical" and me saying "no"

JONKKKK#4186
so yeah cs is just as tactical as r6
wait but just curious:
why do ppl stack?
how is it useful?

Toaster#2600
-unexpected
-funny
-gets you to spots you wouldnt normall be able to get to
ever heard of fast catting

JONKKKK#4186
no

Toaster#2600
see those boxed by ct spawn that sorta stack by cat
gay

JONKKKK#4186
ye

Toaster#2600
you cant get up there with one person but if one person stands on those boxes in the corner and crouches, another person can climb up and you can get to cat sooper sped
thats stacking

JONKKKK#4186
oh wo

Toaster#2600

JONKKKK#4186

Toaster#2600
phone

JONKKKK#4186
but...
no caps..?
like
usually its like

Toaster#2600
i turned it off because bots dont like capitalization

JONKKKK#4186
ohhhh
when you get back we should record astroneer

Toaster#2600
astroneer is fun until you get the first research thing and then realize "oh god this js literally all im doing for the rest kf the game"
it doesnt have enough sibstance yet

JONKKKK#4186
nononononoo
its SO MUCH BETTER NOW
LIKE SRSLY ITS LIKE A NEW GAME

Toaster#2600
no its not lol i messed with it a while ago

JONKKKK#4186
also its kinda like mc where you progress and then do whatever the hecc you want

Toaster#2600
notbreally
because after tou orogress its not kike theres anything new to build
ir anything new to discover
you can tell i turned off autocorrect

JONKKKK#4186
lmao
but its better with frens

Toaster#2600
what did they add
whats new
tell me
give me the food of knowledge

JONKKKK#4186
better base building, a smol rover, and a bunch of other stuff that i havent even discovered yet lol

Toaster#2600
better base buolding as in what

JONKKKK#4186
gay
you can redirect power and stuff and put stuff wherever you want
its not like the old way of using "extend" n stuff

Toaster#2600
that doesnt look like anything new except better graphics and more pod types or whatever
not the type of base building id want in a game like astroneer

JONKKKK#4186
also MOBILE BASES
what type of base building would you want?

Toaster#2600
ask me to play something with you when
-you get more fun to play with
-the game is something i actually like
subanautica base bullding is good

JONKKKK#4186
yeah if astroneer had that it would be pretty lit
but what do you mean "get more fun to play with"

Toaster#2600
you arent super good for videos and 90% of our fameplay is badly forced jokes, me being funny and hou going "no stop that its not funny i will uninstall csgo (not really but you get my point)" , or silent gameplay
also none of the games you want to play are fun so playing with you is just inherently not fun because the game were playing isnt fun

JONKKKK#4186
well its not my fault you only like competitive games

Toaster#2600
not my fault you only like boring games
also competetive what

JONKKKK#4186
games where players are put up against other players

Toaster#2600
j enjoy terraria, mc, bbt, etc

JONKKKK#4186
also how is astroneer boring

Toaster#2600
there isnt enough substance there yet

JONKKKK#4186
dude
what do you mean by that?
what could they add to make it better?

Toaster#2600
base building isnt base bullding, planets are the same thing over and over again, after a specific point there is LITERALLY nothing more to do,

JONKKKK#4186
i mean
you can screw around

Toaster#2600
after you find all the upgrade things or whatever thats it congrats you win theres nktginf else

JONKKKK#4186
no
its

Toaster#2600
theres nothing to screw around *with*

JONKKKK#4186
"congrats, do whatever you want now"
i mean

Toaster#2600
but you CANT do whatever you want

JONKKKK#4186
why is mc fun then?

Toaster#2600
i cant uold a base i want to bhild
i cant create new machines

JONKKKK#4186
you can build a base

Toaster#2600
not a good one

JONKKKK#4186
its kinda janky but you can make it out of dirt
i see what you mean tho

Toaster#2600
you can build a cluster of machines that yoh call a base, vut you cant make a house

JONKKKK#4186
it would be fun to play for a bit

Toaster#2600
you cant design corrodors and make it look how you want

JONKKKK#4186
yes you can

Toaster#2600
no you cant lol

JONKKKK#4186
out of dirt, yes, but you still can

Toaster#2600
if you say "make in out of dirt"- fuck off
the "dirt" looks like shit and even if you did that it still wouldnt look good
did you just leave

JONKKKK#4186
eh

Toaster#2600
stop

JONKKKK#4186
you win
astroneer is garbage

Toaster#2600
its not garbage it just seems unfonished
its jot something id play intil they added a LOT more stuff

JONKKKK#4186
gay

Toaster#2600
exactly

JONKKKK#4186
its releasing fully this december tho and im hyped

Toaster#2600
it is *literally* unfinished

JONKKKK#4186
also you used to like astroneer

Toaster#2600
not too much
even then it was "get the experiment things and then get bored because thats all you do"
and unless they add a lot in hat full release im dtill not playing it

Toaster#2600
its sorta like a combinayion of csgo and minecraft, except out it in space and take away some of the good parts
most of the good parts

JONKKKK#4186
csgo?????
how!???

Toaster#2600
75% mc 25% cd
cs
-cant build freely
-cant code
-cant make your own machines
^from csgo^

-can build things
-can roam freely
-is technically a "sandbox" game
^mc^
not necesarrily csgo
i was just saying its basically minecraft mashed with a game that minecraft shouldnt be mashed with because it takes away all the good elements of a sandbox game
@JONKKKK#4186
im jist gonna start @ing you after everything i say because you take way too long to reslond otherwise
@JONKKKK#4186

JONKKKK#4186
oh sorry
those things arent from csgo, theyre "not in csgo either"
"guys csgo is just minecraft mixed with mayonaise"

Toaster#2600
yeah i mean those are things that, if you mashed cs and mc, thise things would get taken out because those arent elements kf csgo

JONKKKK#4186
yeah, but dont you think anything from csgo would get added in?

Toaster#2600
okay drop the csgo thing that wasnt my fucking point
my point was
its mc except without all the parts that make it a *good sandbox*

JONKKKK#4186
i think its just minecraft, add lots more progression in, and take away most building

Toaster#2600
so basically mega succ

JONKKKK#4186
its like mc mixed with terraria mixed with ksp

Toaster#2600
its like mc moxed with bad
ksp is actually decent and you can BUILD and terraria you can BUILD AND (sortw) CODE AND MOD and in mc uou can BUILD AND MOD AND CODE AND CHANGE TO YOUR HEARTS CONTENT
and in astroneer you cant bUILD OR CODE OR MOD AT ALL

JONKKKK#4186
yeah
you cant build in ksp, and you cant code in terraria
and you can mod in astroneer

Toaster#2600
you can build in ksp and you can mod ksp

JONKKKK#4186
yeah

Toaster#2600
and also you cant really mod astroneer

JONKKKK#4186
but you cant build with blocks
yes you can

Toaster#2600
yeah but yoh can build

JONKKKK#4186
you can build in astroneer

Toaster#2600
actually
jonathan
you cannot mod astroneer right now
gay

JONKKKK#4186
toaster
that was posted 2 years ago

Toaster#2600
and dont say "there will be soon" because therr isnt NOW and NOW is what were talkong about
its still in early access dipshit
you search "astroneer mods" and the only thing tha comes up is wiki pages for the modules in-game

JONKKKK#4186
oh
i coulldve sworn you could mod it

Toaster#2600
yeah fuck off
at leasr *some* stuff on the roadmap looks interesting but even thats all post-launch

JONKKKK#4186
yeah
we should still record it tho

Toaster#2600
i can tell you that im not playing (or at least enJOYING) astroneer until then

JONKKKK#4186
Toaster - Today at 9:41 PM
astroneer is fun until you get the first research thing and then realize "oh god this js literally all im doing for the rest kf the game"
you even admitted its fun at first
and its fun up until you unlock 90% of the stuff

Toaster#2600
yeah, for the firdt like 3 minites it takes to get one

JONKKKK#4186
what?
no, its not boring after that

Toaster#2600
yeah it sorta is

JONKKKK#4186
so youd rather just never unlock anything??

Toaster#2600
once yiu kbow most stuff about a game it gets boring
its discovering new things and being bad (not like super bad but 'new' bad) at a game that makes it fun
thats why we never really do MC anymore

JONKKKK#4186
yeah, but theres so much new that i feel like a noob again

Toaster#2600
not really but sure
you do you

JONKKKK#4186

JONKKKK#4186

Toaster#2600
in the words of nate
"ceas be gay and do something"

JONKKKK#4186
just saw that lol

Toaster#2600
yeah go talk there

Toaster#2600
yknow whatd be fun

JONKKKK#4186
hm
(this is a trap isnt it)

Toaster#2600
hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhHHHHHHHMMMMMMMMMMMM
no its not

JONKKKK#4186
klol
whatd be fun

Toaster#2600
making a labyrinth of discord servers

JONKKKK#4186
...?

Toaster#2600
or at least making a labyrinth on discord
i already have spooky stuff on the hub
theres the friend things which are less spooky and more just private stuff
but also two roles called 01 and 02

JONKKKK#4186
????

Toaster#2600
you can only get to 01 by betting to level 10? (it might be 15 i forget) and then doing !interesting
and then you get access to a secret moderated meme stash and also some chats
i havent done anything with 02 yet but making a massive puzzle with something at the end would be fun

JONKKKK#4186
thatd be cool

Toaster#2600
at the end could be a 30 dollar steam gift card or something idk
youre only lvl 7 lol
you arent cool enuff to be in 01
but yeah making a big puzzle would b fun

JONKKKK#4186
ye

Toaster#2600
we shud do

JONKKKK#4186
ye

Toaster#2600
what should we start with
you should have to be at 01 to get to 02, idk how, and then from 02 you should get linked to another server because im p sure there are so many roles on the hub i cant add more
and even if i can itd still be nice to have another server
or i could totally get rid of 02 and make a server, and then when we have everything set up just send an invite to that server in the hub
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
this just in: I can make more roles thats not an issue
@God#2600
hecc
@JONKKKK#4186
@JONKKKK#4186

JONKKKK#4186
oh
uhh
kewl

Toaster#2600
which one should we do

JONKKKK#4186
in the hub but make an obscure link to another server

Toaster#2600
yeah

JONKKKK#4186
not the hub
tosters plac

Toaster#2600
ye
im in the habit of calling it the hub
but how shud ppl get from 01 to 02
we should make a bot for this
mee6 has limitations i dont like

JONKKKK#4186
idk how to mak bots tho

Toaster#2600
no there are bot creation things
i just found one
wan cal
jok

JONKKKK#4186

JOK
@JONKKKK#4186
@JONKKKK#4186
@JONKKKK#4186

Toaster#2600
I just made a suggestion command
i feel like a coder nerd
even more so than when i was doing csgo binds
cuz im actually coding things
did you just block me
wait what
HAH
WTF

JONKKKK#4186
??

Toaster#2600

Toaster#2600
gay

Toaster#2600
you know whatd be funny

JONKKKK#4186
hm

Toaster#2600
you know how if you say 'gay' in a sentence the bot says no u

JONKKKK#4186
ye

Toaster#2600
what if I made it so every time you said just the letter "u" or "r" as in "u r gay" it would just say "oh man, how much time did you save by not typing "you/are"?

JONKKKK#4186
oo
and also ur

Toaster#2600
yeah
i did it
you should test it idk if its functional

Toaster#2600
hey
@JONKKKK#4186

JONKKKK#4186
hey
@WONKKKK

Toaster#2600
im coding the bot for the beginning of the labyrinth or whatever and right now I have some ideas and made a trello for it because trello is useful for organizing
you should help me come up with hints
on exe.exe (nobody but me can use it right now) theres a =hint command
an =hint command
but yeah it basically generates a random number between 0 and 50 and then depending on what number it is you get a different hint
but idk what hints there should be
other than 50% of the time you get no hint and 1% of the time you get something really useful

JONKKKK#4186
ooo ye
the last one

Toaster#2600
It also sends a message that sayd __**secrets shouldnt be shared**__ and i have it set up so if someone shares their secret i can make it so the =hint command ignores them

JONKKKK#4186
spooky

Toaster#2600
you have a trello accoutn right
atomifire
atomicfire

JONKKKK#4186
i think

Toaster#2600
okay go check it ima invite you to the board
wanna call
makes things easier
Started a call.
I got hints working üòÑ
havent programmed any in
but theyre working
also 40/50 times you dont get a hint
the other 10 times with be 10 random hints I guess
@JONKKKK#4186
how should ppl get from 01 to 02

JONKKKK#4186
they have to say a code in chat that changes once in a while
like just random numbers
like

Toaster#2600
yeah

JONKKKK#4186
1723645
one day
and something else another

Toaster#2600
i dont think it should change though, it should just be you DM it to the bot.
well
from 01 to 02 there could be a hint that says "Decode ------------- (whatever) and send it to God."
and then they DM it to me, I check that they're right, and give them 02

JONKKKK#4186
nonono
it should be
"decode the clues, find all seven, get the code, and send it to heaven"
or something like that

Toaster#2600
eh

JONKKKK#4186
do it better then that lol

Toaster#2600
i dont think that 7/10 clues should be just for getting to 02
brb

JONKKKK#4186
k
or it could have 7 letters in it
or numbers

Toaster#2600
you can brainstorm and write stuff down on the trello
i gotta eet lunch
you should do it

Toaster#2600
hey
ik youre probably asleep but ima @ you and make you do this tomorrow
i know the argument is sorta over and im not trying to bring it back but you were asking me what strategy there is in CS:GO, you should watch (at LEAST this video) some of the videos on this channel: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLVYGXOGUJE
@JONKKKK#4186
only 5 mins so
wotch it

JONKKKK#4186

Toaster#2600

Toaster#2600
oh no

Toaster#2600
hey watch thing

JONKKKK#4186
why tho

Toaster#2600
because
you were asking about csgo strategy
also wanna do something

JONKKKK#4186
eh
i feel like you would actually enjoy r6 if you put a bit more effort into it

Toaster#2600
i feel like you would actually enjoy csgo if you put a bit more effort into it

Toaster#2600
sure sure

JONKKKK#4186
i was making a ***j o k e***

Toaster#2600
__**sure sure**__

JONKKKK#4186
dude i was doing stuff cuz i wanna get a bit better at splatoon and look at what i found
gay
just watch the first 3 seconds

Toaster#2600
fucking AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
I watched a whole 1 SECOND
AND I ALREADY WANT TO DIE
this is why i dont play splatoon
jk i just dont really like splatoon
but if I DID PLAY SPLATOON

JONKKKK#4186
yeah, yeah

Toaster#2600
THAT would be a pretty good reason to stop

JONKKKK#4186
but still ik its kind of geared towards a younger demographic but that doesnt mean older ppl cant play it
like

Toaster#2600
yeah i know but a crazy amount of young children DO play it so the community is all just
ACK

JONKKKK#4186
cod is geared to ~30 year olds but 10 year olds still play it
nah most of the kids arent rlly active in the community
its like

Toaster#2600
jonathan
that isnt my point

JONKKKK#4186
mostly kids play it ultra-casually but more teens/adults play it competitively and are active in the community

Toaster#2600
pretty much everyone sees nintendo as kids games and while some of em are fun or seen as a not-kid game, splatoon is one of those ones that is DEFINETELY SEEN AS A KIDS GAMe
i mean *you* play it so

JONKKKK#4186
because yeah, you would think it would be full of 8 year olds but its really not for some reason
***rekt***
(me)

Toaster#2600
we should actually do something
or work on the bot thing or whatever

JONKKKK#4186
eh
meb

Toaster#2600
this is why youre annoying

JONKKKK#4186

i could make a bot where if you do /s at the end of your message it deletes yours and makes a *nice italics* version of what you said
how have things been
anything interesting happen

JONKKKK#4186
i joined a splatoon team (***shut***) and its pretty fun

Toaster#2600
___***MMMMMMMMMMM***___
big nerd

JONKKKK#4186
nO u

Toaster#2600
what do you mean you joined a team
is it like an ingame thing
like a clan in brawl

JONKKKK#4186
ehh
not *quite*
its a team called team evolution and we all have the "EVO" tag in our name and we do league and stuff together but theres no in built system

Toaster#2600
big dum

JONKKKK#4186
how is it dum?

Toaster#2600
its splatoon
/s

JONKKKK#4186
lmao

Toaster#2600
but the fact that theres no built in team system in a game like splatoon is sorta stoopd

JONKKKK#4186
but i mean
theres no in built vc system either because nintendo is deathly afraid of any toxisity /s
but i MEAN it works
*mostly*
theres still squid bagging but thats really it lol
(((it should be called sea bagging)))

Toaster#2600
that sorta just proves more that its sorta based towards kids

JONKKKK#4186
well yeah

Toaster#2600
dont really feel like arguing that rn but you get what i mean

JONKKKK#4186
its based towards kids but COD is based towards teens lol
its still fun

Toaster#2600
like cmon if you have an online game then youre gonna have toxicity just deal

JONKKKK#4186
yeah
but i mean
theres still league (which is ***basically*** in built teams bc if you dont have vc youll do SUCC) which is fun

Toaster#2600
meh
plus isnt the nintendo vc the big gay

JONKKKK#4186
yES VERY MUCH

Toaster#2600

The world we live in. It's so... Wondrous. Mysterious. Even magical. No... No no no.. Not that world. I meant this one. The smartphone. Each system and program app is it's own little planet of perfect. Technology. All providing services so necessary, so crucial, so unbelievably profound. Look who just sent me a text! Addie McCallister? It must be a mistake. Or a joke. Or a scam! Don't send her your social security number. She's right there! That's our user, Alex. And, like every freshman in high school, his whole life, everything, revolves around his phone. And, because the pace of life gets, faster and faster... Phones down in five. And attention spans get shorter and shorter... And... You're probably not even listening to me right now. Who has the time to type out actual words? And that's where we come in. The most important invention in the history of communication! Emojis. That's my home! Textopolis. Here, each of us does one thing, and we have to nail it every time. Christmas tree just has to stand there, all festive. Merry christmas! It's still september, Tim! And princesses... I am so pretty. They just gotta wear their crowns and keep their hair comb. We are so pretty. Devil, Poop, Thumbs Up, they just show up and they're good to go. But for the faces, the pressure is on. Cryer always has to cry, even if he just won the lottery. Hurray, i'm a millionaire! Laugher's always laughing, even if he's just broken his arm. Ahh!! Ah! I can see the bone!! Ah ah ah ah ah... And me, i'm a meh. So I gotta totally be over it all the time, you know? Like meh, who cares. Which is not as easy as it sounds. I gotta be mehhhhhhhhh I GOTTA! Be! Mehhhhhhhhh. Morning, Mrs. D, I see you have the little minis with ya! Oh, they're so... Cute! NYAH, SO ADORABLE, I CAN'T TAKE IT! I

Toaster#2600
a
did you like my play with jonathan code

JONKKKK#4186
yeah lol

Toaster#2600
i liked talkijg in code lol it was oretty funny

JONKKKK#4186
ye

Toaster#2600
i prob wont do that on my phone though because not letter characters are annoyijg on a phone

JONKKKK#4186
i was doing it on my phone lol

Toaster#2600
well you were doing python which (this is the only reason id like python slightly more) uses less of that

JONKKKK#4186
yeah

Toaster#2600
/s but yknow lol
also you should test a thing in python for me because i want to know if the code thing i was using was dumb or if its python

JONKKKK#4186
?

Toaster#2600
using the input() thing if you put like input(‚Äúwhats your name?‚Äù) then does it ask that in the dialogue box? in my experience it doesnt and if it doesnt then thats a big dealbreaker for me

JONKKKK#4186
uhh
its kinda different than that but basically
i forget how

Toaster#2600
whenever i did it like that the console output would just be whatever i put in parenthesis and then whatever the user input was

JONKKKK#4186
its like

Toaster#2600
i havent tried it with variables i dint think

JONKKKK#4186
x = input('message')
if(message == 'ur mom triple gay'):
    print('no u')

Toaster#2600
nonono

JONKKKK#4186
?

Toaster#2600
like okay in javascript you can do prompt(‚ÄúHow old are you?‚Äù) and in the dialogue box you see the message ‚ÄúHow old are you?‚Äù but i dont think you can do that in python
like have the dialogue box have a message in it

JONKKKK#4186
WAIT NO
hang on
its ***actually***
x = input('message')
if(x == 'ur mom triple gay'):
    print('no u')
so yeh you can have a custom message

Toaster#2600
?
hold on im coding something really quick to demonstrate

JONKKKK#4186
so for example:
momTripleGay? = input('is my mom triple gay?')
if(momTripleGay? == yes):
    print('no u')
else:
    print('yeah thats what i thought')

Toaster#2600
does that work?

JONKKKK#4186
pretty sure

Toaster#2600
i did make an example of the javascript stuff online
jsfiddle.net/Lgeauf6r/5/
that didnt turb into a link
wtv

JONKKKK#4186
momTripleGay = input('is my mom triple gay?')
if(momTripleGay == 'yes'):
    print('no u')
else:
    print('yeah thats what i thought')
yeah this works

Toaster#2600
no yeah see
see
gay

JONKKKK#4186

Toaster#2600
sanity is a meter, if your sanity goes all the way up then everything turns black and you start taking constant damage until you die
malevolent dmg is just another dmg type
like melee or ranged
theres also symphonic dmg lol
there are instruments you can play for damage
ugh
snipping tool is dumb recently

JONKKKK#4186

Toaster#2600

or ill get some semi decent teammates but this game doesnt feel like that lol

JONKKKK#4186

Long before I actually had this answer in hand, I could sense that the patterns of the beats and noise meant something. The sound would move me, my head nodding to the beeps that followed the initial connection. You could feel two things trying to come into sync: Were they computers or me and my version of the world?

As I learned again today, as I learn every day, the answer is both.

Toaster#2600
just had a nICE comp match
ive been getting good luck recently
@JONKKKK#4186 wanna do something?

JONKKKK#4186
@ing people doesnt do anything in dms

Toaster#2600

im looking through my uninstalled games lol
any ideas

JONKKKK#4186
n

Toaster#2600
I still think that making a game would be fun

JONKKKK#4186
we SHOULD

Toaster#2600
should we like brainstorm

JONKKKK#4186
well
we should also try and learn unity
it works with js p sure

Toaster#2600
im watching this rn
gay

JONKKKK#4186
ok so i feel like i should be in charge of game design
and you be in charge of coding and art
(but we both do both)

Toaster#2600
idrc

JONKKKK#4186
idk how to use js so yeah you can code

Toaster#2600
if (jonathan === "BIG NERD") {
   alert("xd get gud")
}

JONKKKK#4186
===?
its == right?

Toaster#2600
js is a bit weird

JONKKKK#4186
ok lol

Toaster#2600
idrk the exact diff but === means its EXACT
NOTHING ELSE
ONLY THAT
i just use it because idk
it doesnt really matter which you use

JONKKKK#4186
yeah in python = is to set and == is what === is in js
like
tost = big gae

Toaster#2600
yeah that sets it
here
oh okay

JONKKKK#4186
if (tost == big gae):
   print: (gotem xd)

Toaster#2600
i just researched
so == compares them and does type conversion
but === doesnt do any type conversion so if its not the same type it returns false

JONKKKK#4186
o ok looooooooooo

Toaster#2600
like

JONKKKK#4186
i get it

Toaster#2600
true == 1 is true
true === 1 is false

Toaster#2600
oof

JONKKKK#4186
any suggestions?

Toaster#2600
make the hair shadows actually look like the hair
also add neck shadowsd
also try adding lips? I know it makes you look feminine (ive tried it on a lota drawings lol) but maybe?
or try getting rid of the chin dimple thing
thats my 2 cents
also check out my bank program im happy with it

JONKKKK#4186
ok yknow what
this isnt working

Toaster#2600
hm

JONKKKK#4186
imma make it more abstract

Toaster#2600
oh
just do cartoony
thats what ima do lol

JONKKKK#4186
nono i think abstract and minimalist would look cool

Toaster#2600
m
that was one thing i was thinking of trying

JONKKKK#4186
ok

Toaster#2600
you know the style where everything is triangles

JONKKKK#4186
ooo

Toaster#2600
yeah

JONKKKK#4186
tryyyyyyyy iiiiiiittttttttttttt

Toaster#2600
that seems cool to try
you sohuld try too

JONKKKK#4186
nah
i did just the shading layer and it looks SO GOOD
gay
how do you liek
gay

Toaster#2600
ü§î
very abstract and thot provoking
really makes you think about the nature of human existence
3/69 would sell for way too much at a modern art museum
jk
i guess its good lol
im not an abstract art person

JONKKKK#4186
wahoo
gay
wahoo times too
gay

Toaster#2600
hey you know the triangle thing iw as talking about

JONKKKK#4186
ye

Toaster#2600
i took this because im unoriginal and making myself was too hard

JONKKKK#4186
?

Toaster#2600
my internet is dying
one sec
took this
gay

JONKKKK#4186
and?

Toaster#2600
made this
gay

JONKKKK#4186
kewl

Toaster#2600
gay

Toaster#2600
does this look as weird to you as it does to me?
gay
it just looks
*off*
not the drawing
the pixel grid
its just slightly rotated cuz im drawing semi sideways
and it looks really weird
to me at least

JONKKKK#4186
ye lol

Toaster#2600
it makes it look really jagged
like moreso than a normal pixel grid

JONKKKK#4186
can i see the whole thing?

Toaster#2600
too lazy to rotate it back so
gay

JONKKKK#4186
ew
its like
the drawing is good
but doing the thing where its just a bunch of stuff around your head is just
bland

Toaster#2600
i mean im just doing the smallest amount of work to pass this project
itll get an easy A so
you can do what you want

JONKKKK#4186
it wont get an a lol

Toaster#2600
yeah it iwll

JONKKKK#4186
hes judging on apparent effort and, well

Toaster#2600
youre just mad that you actually put effort in and will probably get a worse grade
with like any assignment

JONKKKK#4186
what even is that part that youre drawing anyway

Toaster#2600
if you can do it on the computer then its really just an easy A
because like the project i did for mr vance (that one was a sorta special case cuz mr vance was lit) you can just half ass it and youll get a good grade because "wow its on the computer and its decently done"
sometimes you dont even have to decently do it
also
may i remind you
that yours is just a mess of gray and then a green mass that sorta resembles some miscellanious computer part for the head
and also I agree that its bland and stupid but itll get an A lol

JONKKKK#4186
uhhhh
i dont think it will

Toaster#2600
yeah
its pretty much garaunteed to

JONKKKK#4186
why do you say that?

Toaster#2600
because its decently made and half of my class is probably gonna be much worse since its that group of people that puts no effort into school at all
its like i said doing stuff on the comp is pretty much an easy a

JONKKKK#4186
no??

Toaster#2600
yeah

JONKKKK#4186
he specifically said "you can do a drawing if clear effort is shown"

Toaster#2600
yeah
p clear effort
well drawn and colored

JONKKKK#4186
and for yours at least I can tell you put no effort into it
nonoNOoo

Toaster#2600
well duh you know that i put no effort into anything school related

JONKKKK#4186
OBJECTION!
gay
You forgot a crucial point! It's not about the art, but the SYMBOLS!

Toaster#2600
yeah

JONKKKK#4186
ok yeah idek
but what are your symbols?

Toaster#2600
video editing, a toaster, a computer, music notes, and art but idk what to really do for the art one
maybe ill add some flashy drug bg or something
thatll look like SUPER EFFORT
nah lol

JONKKKK#4186
well i mean its not supposed to represent what you like

Toaster#2600
also you gotta admit

JONKKKK#4186
its supposed to represent who you ARE

Toaster#2600
high quality computer
gay

JONKKKK#4186
