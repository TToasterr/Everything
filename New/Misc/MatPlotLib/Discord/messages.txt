01

01
hey jok

07
heyo neyto

07
why have you not existed like all day

07
Just didn’t feel like it

07
I decided not to exist today

07
well you missed the premiere screening of the news episode

07
Eh

07
and also lost the opportunity to record the next one

07
Really?

07
mhm

07
How was it explained is all I care about

07
what do u meen

07
How was my absence explained

07
oh we didnt record it

07
?

07
What

07
i was saying we coulda recorded it

07
Oh

07
everyone was online and ready to do it except u

07
Nah it’s ok

07
Idrc

07
its annoyin for me tho

07
cuz i do in fact enjoy editing

07
and also it woulda been a really fun one to record since we all switch places

07
We already suck at uploading on time

07
also now it is canon that liam is better than u at science and you always try to be way cooler than him and either mess up or he does better and u cant no u because you werent here

07
And this was like one time compared to jonk and Liam’s like 20 times each

07
yeah that makes it worse

07
What

07
because the ONE TIME they were both here is the ONE TIME you WERENT here

07
literally any other day probably woulda been better

07
Jonk is because he has gay ok

07

07
Jon

07

07
Has

07
Gay

07

Attention everyone, be on the look out for a mended schedule for this week, as it’s now cut down to 3 days.

'Cause you're yes then you're cold
You're in then you're no
You're up then you're out
You're hot then you're down

07
No

07
To the tune of Katy Perry’s hot n cold

07
Cause you're hot then you're cold
You're yes, then you're no
You're in, then you're out
You're up, then you're down
You're wrong when it's right

07
That's the actual lyrics

09
they wouldnt??????

09
then howd they find the original post?????????????????????????

09
by sorting by new and getting lucky

09
and also you didnt include any images of the pack just a download link thats sorta very annoying maybe dont do that???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????

09
ok fINE ill add images

the above was said by a robotic priest, pretending to shoot the last three humans alive with finger guns

10
the last three humans alive wasnt being pretended, just the finger guns part

10
wait so did he kill them or not

10
nono he was trying to kill/smite them but hes delusional so nothing was actually happening

10
like what im getting is:
1. he was just pretending that the last 3 humans were alive
2. he killed them with real guns pretending that he killed them with finger guns

oh ok

10
but you have to admit

10
"the last three humans alive wasnt being pretended, just the finger guns part"

10
nah there are only 3 ppl alive (5 rly) and he was pretending to shoot them

10
while stqnding on another (dying) robot who has an erection

10
i get that but what did "the last three humans alive wasnt being pretended" mean because i can't decipher that

wat

06
You talk too much, @Serendipity. You just advanced to level 2.

06
No wait

06
Why

06
wish discord was more open source

06
rocket.chat looks neat but also no vc and also elss well

06
but fully open source

06
:Thonk:

06
nah fam im good

06
what

06
i wouldnt want to move to rocket.chat if thats what youre suggesting

06
nono im just saying its an epic gamer because its open source

06
open source  = good

06
ok lol

06
thats one of the main reasons atom = good

06
Rice chat looks pretty good.

06
Rocket chat

06
rocket?

06
lol

06
Autocorrect

06
Gah

06
i wonder if rocket is unblocked at school..?

06
owo

06
But yeah, if they added VC, i would seriously consider it.

06
Because open source is nice.

06
And that's why I use Linux.

06
id use linux if it could actually run .exes

06
but until then no thakns

06
and *no, i dont want to use wine or wtv it is*

06
Actually, it looks like rocket chat does have VC maybe?
But I see what you mean.

06
Wine is tricky.

06
?

06
I just dual

06
autocorrect?

06
No

06
?

06
Wine is tricky.

06
oh wine?

06
wine is a program

06
supposed to let you run exes on linux (and mac since mac is just a linux os)

06
but very complicated and hard to get working

06
not worth it imo

06
Mac is unix.

06
Not Linux

06
Linux is also unix

06
''''''''''''*same thing xd*''''''''''''

06
u know what a mean

06
Similar, ya.

06
But Linux is better

06
shore

06
The reason Linux doesn't use exes is because it used other app formats.

06
Not as neat as .app in Mac, tho.

06
yeah but it means you cant run like 90% of games and also not many programs

06
.app is really easy to manage if you aren't a Dev

06
And us

06
Ya

06
not 100% sure about programs but still jeesussss

06
Programs are usually cross

06
But games are an issue.

06
Which is why I dual boot.

06
yeah but then i feel like id just never use the linux side

06
Also, Windows works better on touch yuck screen.

06
Ya, you probably wouldn't.

06
I often don't use it.

06
cus yes i like linux for the customizability but id just have everything on the windoos siide

06
Microsoft should just make a Linux distro.

I say “Alexa, stop” in my firmest voice. The music quiets down. I think I’ve won, but oh boy was I wrong. She says to me “The time is 1:17 AM” and begins blasting that cursed song again. I tell her to stop over and over but she doesn’t listen. I reach over to unplug her. The wire comes out with little resistance. Her last words haunt me to this day... “Slide to the l

minecraft resource pack but every texture is deep fried and every sound is bass boosted to shit

06
Nice.

06
You should actually do that, just to fuck with people.

08
i made a Minecraft texture pack where everything is a chest, when the chest meme was a thing.

08
lmao i just got banned from r/dankmemes for 'being a european'

08
and the message is like 'dont appeal we have too many people trying'

08
*hmmmmmmmm then maybe you should get a better bot*

08
oooof

08
wait European? then it would be uuuuuuuf

08
yeah article 13 was just passed

08
That's an oof.

08

03

03
its not the best but then again i got it yesterday so

03
whyd you get a 3d pen lol

03
also other question whyd you break my bot lol

03
ive wanted one for a while

03
i cant remote into my comp and restart it so now im sad

03
sorry

03
idk how i broke it

03

03
i made a fish and an alien tree

03
Ok

03
(mostly because i dont have brown lol)

03
what

03
wtf lol

03
I was wondering what the fuck that first think is

03
and i think i know why i got snapped

03
in dankmemes

03
its because i usually post at night

03
yeah idk i think 3D pens are sorta just a fad cuz unless you get *really fuccin good* you wont be able to make anything useful

03
also jok prolly not

03
well *yeah*

03
prolly because they just dont have a good bot

03
its not supposed to make things useful

03
its supposed to make art

03
useful things are for 3d printers

03
but even then its like

03
not very good art lol

03
i think of it as something that you show someone when they come over to your house for the first time and then let them mess around with it for an hour and then youre both bored

03
its kinda like “hey thats neat but also why”

03
wtv i wont mess with ur fun lol

03
but yeah the r/dankmemes thing is dumb

03
shoulda just

03
i at least think its fun lol

03
but yeah it is

03
well hm

03
article 13 doesnt even apply to memes

03
what? yes it does

03
thats not why its dumb tho

03
even if it didnt apply to memes r/dankmemes is the *only* sub whos acted on it, and its retarded that they did because it isnt even in effect yet and the individual subreddits wouldnt need to do anything, reddit as a website would

03
so the mods of dankmemes just actually have two braincells

03
collectively

03
Actually one of them got lost last week.  So now they're only one brain cell and they all have to share.

03
ack

The true question is why not

09
but i think im kinda low on yellow

09
Wait how sturdy is the 3d drawn stuff?

09
im low on basically everything at this point lmao

09
and its pretty sturdy

09
like

09
Not very if you do it wrong tho

09
Make a switch stand that isnt a ig gay kickstand

09
depends on how big it is but its not fragile

09
I have my 3D pen lying around somewhere

09
ehhhh thats more a job for 3d printing

09
Mines broken

09
aw

09
I should get one

09
but like

09
idk

09
wait what you guys have 3d pens??

09
I wish

09
You know this

09
I do.. probably in storage tho

09
you could probably just come over to my house sometime and make some stuff

09
yeah maybe

09
but the filament is EXPENSIVE lmao

09
I could do the 999

09
Yeah

09
Idk where you live

09
i spent like 30 bucks earlier today ordering a couple packs

09
i found a pack of flex filament for like 5 bucks

09
nice

09
You talk too much, @Zildin. You just advanced to level 3.

09
When I got mine my grandparents also got me a big filament box with like 200 ft of like any color I could want

09
Oh wow

09
JESUS

09
Wait jonk make a kirby

09
OO thats good

09
but later

09
Which is why I’m big sad that it’s broken

09
because its late

09
is it like spools of filament?

09
Yeah

09
What kind of 3D pen did you had

09
oooof

09
with mine it spins while going in so i cant really do rolls of it

09
But they were specifically for that pen

09

07
but yeah we just ordered a replacement

08
wow nice seems really worth the buy

08
oh nah replacements free

08
100% would get one just for it to break in two days

08
tbh having a blast with it

08
little more than two days

08
its  f r e e

08
(replacement is)

08
im glad u got this while im on vaca cuz then youll be bored of it when i get back

08
hopefully

08
shkulda gotten it earlier

08
wish there was more of a playerbase for duck game cuz none of you play it and its hard to find an online match cuz its not super popular

08
been wanting to play it lots recently for no reason

08
also just a thing i never said that it costed money @JONKKKK i was just saying it sounds very extraordinarily sturdy if youre gonna have to replace it every other week

08
also do you just not care about your nickname or like that one a bunch cuz its been that for a little while

08
same with nate but nate set his own

08
idk i just expect ppl to change their name when i change it for them lol

08
lol just havent gotten around to it

08
UNTIL NOW

08
that name is illegal

08
(but also seriously whos dr bright)

08
anyone who doesnt know dr bright or dr clef should be sacrificed

08
to dr bright or dr clef

08
pls explain

08
@GoldenPot8o change ur nick to dr clef lol

08
hol up

08
you can do it for him

08
http://www.scp

08
that should give a pretty good representarion of his character (at least in the best canon xd)

08
if that article isnt canon for you then youre doing it wrong

08
alrighty so basically hes the best

08
yes correct thanks

08
http://www.scp

08
so basically you should change your nickname

08
/s

08
(((but only a bit)))

08
seese

08
dr clef is second best thx

08
whats he like?

08
reed above link pls

08
*"first came to the attention of the Foundation after publishing a seminal research paper, "On the use of Human Semen to ████ ███████ ██ █████ █████████,""*

08
yes

08
ok so what im getting is that he just doesnt give a single f

08
if i ever make an actually functional scp game theres gonna be a 1/1000 chance that onstead of spawning as a scientist you spawn as dr bright and your job is just to kill everything

08
you start with an inventory full of micros and just

08
k i l l e v e r y t h i n g

08
not 1 in 1000

08
1 in 50 seems good

08
like

08
1 in 50 scientists

08
1 in 100 at the LEAST

08
nonon

08
every person who spawns as a scoentist (it picks classes first, so scp, dboi, scientist, etc) generates a random number 1

08
if two people get it in the same game one is dr clef

08
nah i feel like it should be more common than that

08
so its like

08
v rare

08
but it makes for a fun game for bright/clef lol

08
because i feel like it would be a fun easter egg but also a fun game mechanic

08
i recently like very low chance thingsyo

08
u saw my most recent idea in #deleted

08
rite

08
yeah

08
the thing is you dont realise how low of a chance something is until you have to roll for it

08
like

08
1 in 20 is still PRETTY rare

08
like

08
thats a 5% chance

08
(((not with the plugin)))

08
*wakes up one month from now
gets on computer
opens discord
starts typing to jonathan
**EARRAPENITE***

08
also too low

08
(((i kinda get it with the plugin)))

08
it needs to be more rare

08
in game i can sorta see more common

08
but yeah the dr bright thing should be 1 in 50 imo

08
maybe like

08
but since its literally like

08
cant die and kills everything

08
number out of 100, 1 is bright 2 is clef or whatever he was called

08
OP pls nerf
so
low chance

08
though if i made an scp game i TOTALLY would have a ton of like 1/10 to 1/500 chance things that just happen randomly

08
that seems *kinda* cool

08
so every game has some wacky new shit

08
lost dataaaaaa

08
hellppppp

08
but the dr bright thing is too good of an idea to make that rare

08
ah im back

08
maybe okokok

08
so are you on your way back?

08
becoming dr bright is 1/50 (but you have to be a scientist first so still semi rare) but getting the inv full of micros is like 1/50 even after youve gotten bright.
so 1/50 and then ANOTHRR 1/50 to see if you get the micros
if no micros, its just a name change and maybe a slightly higher keycard as a small advantage

08
also no

08
tomorrow

08
yeah i think it should just be no micro or maybe 1 micro

08
ithink waisiaiwiaa

08
wait

08
hol yp

08
and your goal is to get as many enemy kills as you can

08
or something

09
ok so i made a fake csgo crash thing, and the random number gen for that is like lower numbers are way more common (its rare to get a 3, you usually get 1
that except it determins how many micros you start with
very VERY high = full inv
<10 = 3 or 4
<5 = 2
❤ = 1
<1.75 = 0

09
oh shit < 3 autocorrects to heart lol

09
n i c e

09
maybe <2 = 1 and <1

09
u get the idea thi

09
tho

09

ye is goo

09
You talk too much, @Speguni. You just advanced to level 1.

09
hehe

09

09

09
he used to be v good

09

09
I haven't been able to practice in a while bit I'm gonna get some time in before I come over there

09
oh no

09
I honestly can't wait to meet everyone tho

09
hell yeah

09
im excited

10
It'll be intresting to actually get to know some of the people I've been playing splatoon with

10
hah

10
nobodys online right now but yeah

10
I remember it was one of your last days here and we were walking home together and I was trying to get you to buy a switch

10
But you still haven't

10
lmao i dont think i ever will

10
you should try to convince nintendo to put their games on pc because uhhhhh

10



10
But then we wouldn't get the innovationnnnnnn

10
what

10
oh you mean the uhhhh

10
whatever its called where you can tilt the controllers to move the camera

10
Well all that kind of stuff

10
thats the only one i can think of

10
Nintendo has been the biggest innovator in terms of consoles

10
yes

10
but

10
console bad

10
xd

10
This is untrue

10
console bad pc good

10
Don't let this man spread these lies any longer

10
**console bad pc good**

10
Console dab pc doog

10
dude

10
Checkmate

10

10
left wing destroyed

10
(Dont worry Dylan I'm on your side)

10
c o n s o l e b a d

10
you cant say that consoles have better specs and more options than pc because they d o n t

10
its just a f a c t

10
It pretty much just comes down to personal preference at that point

10
Well yeah usually but you can take the switch with you in a car ride

10
you can take a laptop in a car ride

10
Is quantity or quality more important to you

10
¯\_(ツ)_/¯

10
If I had a laptop is use it

10
I would rather have zelda than gmod

10
But I don't and the switch has good games

10

https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/539106814697013250/562488289513177088/unknown.png

10
Ok imma schleemp

10

checkmate athiests

10
it's gonna be one of those am2r situations tho

10
Nintendo is very harsh with their copyright stuff

10

https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/539106814697013250/562488751448653824/unknown.png

10
see

10
but if nintendo just

10
released their games for pc

10


10


10
ez untapped market right there

10
But I would prefer the console innovation honestly

10
cuz theres obviously demand for it

10
Nintendo lead to modern vr

10
what?

10
never heard that b4

10
not saying its false just sayin w h a t ? ? ?

10
explain pls

10
Virtual boy and the Wii motion stuff

10
oh yeah sure

10
that sounded sarcastic

10
i meant like

10
Virtual boy was shit admittedly but it lead to innovation

10
yeah youre right lol

10
Na yeah it's cool I understood

10
idk why but 'sure' always seems sarcastic to me over text

10
its like

10
an inherently sarcastic word

10
idk

10
Yeah

10
I see what you mean

10
you can make it obviously sarcastic with like

10
suuuuuurree

10
¯\_(ツ)_/¯

10
Making things sound not sarcastic over text is a very real challenge

10
yeah lol

10
Even that sentence sounds sarcastic

10
ok i should sleep cuz i need to get readjusted to the time zone instead of staying up till 12 every night

10
hyped for you coming over here tho

10
Yeah I can't wait

10

Fun fact the reason you can’t use a pencil eraser to tap your phone is because the phone senses temperature

09
So you can tap your phone with a cold piece of metal

09
Yeah

09
I put my phone against my desk and because apple suggests words it typed that

09
YOU CANNOT IMAGINE THE PAIN OF BEING ANCHORED TO A SPOT AND THEN TORN FROM IT, ENDURING PAIN BECAUSE SOMETHING ELSE TOLD YOU TO

                    msg.edit(`${msg.content}\n*femur breaker noises continue*`);
                }
                else {

                    setTimeout(function() {
                        message.channel.send(`**SCP

D

07
wAt

07
d

07
K so it’s a spooky thing that is whatever you expect it to be

07
And the d

07
no wouldnt you actually die tho?

07
No no

07
because if you expect to die then you do

07
yeah you would

07
you would die

07
because your brain thinks its dead

07
so it would just stop functioning

07
...

07
any time you died to it youd just have a fucking stroke

07
We decided that they just think they are dead

07
whos we?

07
This was decided

07
us?

07
Toaster and I

07
lies

07
because i never agreed to this

07
Obviously I am not apart of said "we"

07
Oh also toaster read the update to the E

07
okok

07
so when you said that i imagined a lowercase e

07
No

07
ikik

07
Lowercase q with two tails facing opposite ways

07
P but the line goes up and the circly thing stays in the same spot

07
lowercase e with 4 lines

https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/539106814697013250/563531608716738560/unknown.png

07

07
nono thats the circle moved down

07
You talk too much, @JONKKKK. You just advanced to level 12.

07
Oh no

07
nate said its the line moved up

07
A sea expedition with an E with 4 lines as the flag, the foundation would just have to incinerate an entire fucking boat

07
Napalm time

07
so whats up with the four line e

07
See

07
I’m

07
Um

07
I made a typo

07
And

07
Well

07
E with 4 lines happened

07
Do you wanna write a part?

07
Konk

08
`i'm gonna ssh into your microwave and fucking heat your toes up slightly too much`

08
you know whatd be really fucking funny

08
well

08
idk

08
What

08
itd only be funny if we like actively did it

08
Also @JONKKKK you want me to send the E scp to you?

08
if we all made twitter accounts (i think i might already have one but id prolly remake it) and just the *only* thing we did on them is argue with each other using rare insults and retarded topics

08
Or an arg would be cool

08
yeah but ARG wouldnt be as funny

08
and yeah sure nate

08
Combine the 2

08
It’s on your school account

08
*you absolute fucking microwave*

08
see okay

08
*you (adjetive) (curse word) (noun)*

08
having something like twitter where we're all active would be funny as fuck because i can 100% imagine being woken up at like 1AM by a tweet from nate @ing me with just the most cursed goddamn image on the internet

08
Why me

08
That’s racist

08
just waking up to a tweet at you of that guy who had 10k hours on garfield kart

Fun fact, you don’t actually need to see the big screen for jackbox

You could host a game and we could all play

It tells you what’s happening on the mobile screen

01
really? wouldnt you not be able to see the stuff

01
No no, it gives you all you need

01
how

01
the big screen is just a fancier version of the mobile screen

01
what do you mean the mobile screen

01
On the screen screen you play on it gives you your prompts, and what to answer, and all the answers

01
didnt give me all the answers

The only one it doesn’t give you is your own submission

08

08
yeah ok

08

08
i mean like 2

08
also 6+7

08

08
1 is diff
2
4
6

08
in 2+3 and 6+7 you can still se s l i g h t shade differences

08
what

08
is

08
that

08
Whatever you want it to be

08
suddenly wholesome?

08
I mean if you want?

09
***Foreboding clouds above the quite quiet night and frazzled fuming minds***

09
Is this a dnd boss intro

09
*nate has joined the battle*

09
Fuck

09
Prepare for a bunch of bullying

09
is that

09
okay

09
so

09
you just had a very intense intro

09
What

09
with clouds

09
and such

09
and the first thing you say when the players notice you is

09
"fuck"

09
"prepare for a bunch of bullying"

09
Oh I’m the boss?

09
I thought I was a player

09
>player explains to boss that theyre the boss

09
What is happening?

09
>boss didnt know

09
Fite me Liam

09
....I hope y'all realize that was just a random sentence I made up....

09
no its Nates boss intro

09
cant go back now

09
Okie dokie

09
I’m a boss just because of the sheer ***__B I G  B R A I N__***

09
its your one disadvantage tho

09
it weighs you down

09
Isa fite me

09
Yeah lol

09
So

09
I will don't challenge me

09
You talk too much, @Serendipity. You just advanced to level 6.

09
Nate’s a boss now?

09
Intelligence 200
Speed 5

09
we need to have a channel thats a DND campaign except everything you do in that channel you do as your character

09
and also no deleting messages

09
Dibs on dm

09
nonononono

09
dm is also player

09
But that’s so hard

09
you tell general story points but its made up as we go for the most part

09
you dont have a thing thats like

09
"oh hey there are monsters here on this part of the map"

09
even time we change location

09
a random player rolls a dice

09
and depending on what they roll

09
there are either monsters or no monsters

09
*change my mind*

09
That’s not how it works

09
>walks into dungeon
>rolls nat 20
>clears dungeon with one dice roll

09
🅱

09
AC of 1 but I can dodge many attacks

09
doing a dnd campaign in discord wouldnt be hard

09
like at all

09
We should make a new server for it tho

09
I don’t think just anyone can join

09
what do you meaaannn

09
just inside a random dungeon in the middle of an intense battle

09
and some rando joins just like "hey guys"

09
"hey guys its scarce here"

09
Xavier, Nikolai, random

09
i could make a bot that keeps track of player stats

09
character sheets but

09
d i s c o r d b o t

09
I could just rollout character sheets to everyone

09
Cause commanding the bot to open the sheet every turn would be annoying

09
I love how I barely even get whats happening and it's great

09
it could just DM you a sheet and then edit the message as it updates

09
Isa you would actually have a bunch of fun with dnd

09
but thatd be sorta hard

09
You should join my campaign

09
me or isa

09
Isa

09
You’re in my campaign

09
I'd be a lost dog

09
ohh oh yeah

09
thuoght you meant gay dnd club campaign for some reason

09
It’s ok so is everyone else

09
Nono

09
This is quite a tempting offer, what are the qualifications

09
Also we need to continue the campaign at some point now that I know what I’m doing

09
Qualifications: literally just have a school computer and be able to come to the teen center sometimes

09
Questions: why do we need a school computer

09
How often is sometimes?

09
like never

09
Makes it way easier to have stuff digitalization

09
Would I get yelled at for not understand anything

09
Are you full time living on my street? Cause I’m riding the bus to the teen center on Friday

09
You could come with and I could help you make a character

09
ill probably go to TC on friday

09
What time Friday

09
I'm living on your street half to three fourths of the time..my parents be are divorced

09
Don’t know yet I’ll let you know when o figure out the bus schedule

09
Ok

09
Yep

09
oof divorced parents seem suck

09
I didn’t know how things got smoothed out

09
@JONKKKK I'm used to it

09
I also have better ideas now so I could restart the campaign

09
And I’m like aware what’s happening

09
aw man

09
@GoldenPot8o why not, I guess I'll join

09
we should keep it going but sorta just ignore what weve done so far

09
like

09
i want to keep my building

09
i agree

09
we should just keep going cuz we were like 0% in

09
I could keep going but you might have to make your character sheets better lol

09
ye lol

09
And I might make role playing and stuff better

09
Now that I understand what a good campaign looks like

09
i still think we should do a discord dnd improv thing

09
because going to the teen center isn't really consistent

09
Separate campaign tho

09
because discord calling is a lot easier then going to the tc

09
ye ye seperate campaign

09
fuck im blanking on names of stuff

09
if my strength is 15 but then i get +2

09
whats the 15 called and whats the +2

09
proficiency?

09
i thiiiiink?

09
bonus?

09
The 15 is your score, +2 is your modifier

09
thx bb

09
:CattoBlush:

09
fucking hell lmao

09
What

09
i forgot that i put my only flaw as being friends with jonathan

09
Oof

09
:(

09
also i still have 2 pebbles in my inventory

09
Yeah I might be more strict on role playing stuff

09
Cause it really does make the game more fun

09
wdym this game is already great

09
That’s my point

09
Because if you rp good then there are things that happen like this
*party is getting nowhere talking to a voice behind the door*
Me: listen asshole, we’re gonna go beat the shit out of ral (the bad guy) cause he’s part of the plan for the world to end
Voice: yeah u right lol

09
what

09
@GoldenPot8o how much are pebbles worth in GP

09
0.1 cp

09
So every 10000 pebbles is one gold

09
*in GP*

09
0.001?

09
or 0.00001

09
0.00001

10
do you remember what "gold orb sky code" was

10
apparently i have one in my inventory

10
Sky or spy

10
sky

10
OH it’s the gold orb that you were supposed to put in the statues hand

10
But you did a jonathan

10
And yoinked all the loot

10
ohhh okay

10
how much is it worth

10
yknow what we should do to keep track of everything

10
put it in a spreadsheet

10
like

10
die 20

10
Fok

10
just a spreadsheet that lists every item weve come across and the price per one

10
also 1d20?

10
thats the price?

10
thats not that much for a solid gold orb lol

10
No no

10
Just roll

10
oh one sec

10
Are you selling it?

10
I mean

10
no i just like having prices for stuff in my inv instead of "N/A"

10
I guess your motivation is money

10
You’re basically heros for hire

10
also how much is my store worth

10
10,000 for the store, 2000 for the orb to any normal seller, more if you sell it to the right person

10
Also you could use the store to sell adventuring services and the items you find lol

10
okay

10
prices for all N/A pls
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/539106814697013250/568286587696447488/unknown.png

10
Imma say that you can’t sell gear

10
aw whattt

10
So I’m

10
what about bricks

10
bricks are like tons of tiny pebbles squished together

10
so like at least 0.001 gp

10
pls

10
But it’s like enter the gungeon *** infinite weapons ***

10
Um 1 sp you do the conversion

10
0.0001

10
thats what im taking it as

10
thx

10
What I was giving you was worth more but ok

10
well idfk the conversion and im too lazy to figure it out so im taking the lower price

10
You can just google it

10
Hey what if I just um

10
*announcment* everyone in my irl campaign is now level 5

10

https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/539106814697013250/568289845420752907/unknown.png

10
think i got everything

10
oh heck wait

10
fUCK WHERE DO I PUT THIS

10
Um fun fact

10
The character sheet that I can send you on the school computers can do all the calculations for you

10
for gp and stuff?

10
what else is there calculations for lol

10
I mean skills and modifiers, AC, DC, hit die

10
Everything that involves math

10
nothing really involves math tho?

10
like

10
Except yeah it does

10
what do you mean

10
"skills and modifiers" oh okay so it can do 15+2 for me
"AC" dont even remember what that means
"DC" same with this one lol
"hit cease the reproduction process of cells" what are you talking about

10
There are literally proportionality calculations to determine modifiers and proficiency bonuses

10
what

10
you mean

10
whatever i rolled

10
plus 2

10
or whatever my modifier is

10
such a hard calculation

10
AC= how hard it is to hit you
DC= how hard it is for you to hit and do things
Hit die=what you roll to see if you hit the thing
And no, your modifier is +2 because your score is 15 not the other way around

10
oh yeaah forgot that thats how you calculated that stuff

10
but again

10
its not like thats hard

10
idk them exactly but its just

10
if its less than this then its this

10
thats not really proportionality

10
You better shut up before I go full dark souls on your ass

10
oh wait ur on ur phone u have bad

10
was gonna say send me the one youre talking about

10
so i could verify my memory of it looking <good

10
Alright

10
For every dumb thing you say I’m making another boss

10
what dumb thing did i say there

10
and also i dont mind lol

10
bosses have good

10
Mm

10
You’re fighting a big robot now

10
except prolly not

10
And a demon who lives in a volcano

10
because do you really expect us to both play frequently enough and also want to play enough to actually get anywhere

10
also

10
"i pursuade them to not fight us"
>nat 20

10
do i need to remind you of last time

10
Yes lol

10
so i do need to remind you of last time

10
basically

10
persuation 100

10
mr short term memory loss xd

10
idk does that count as short or long term

10
it was a while ago

10
(see above point about us not playing frequently)

10
u exist or should i stop paying attention to my phone

10
oh god i just got a terrible idea

10
Also I have a 🅱izza account with monis so I can 🅱izza on Friday

10
discord plugin that looks for every time you say “your” “youre” “ur” etc. and replaces it with the wrong one

10
same with their theyre there

10
oh yeah i was also gonna make a website that uses socketio to talk to a discord bot that lets you do dnd functions (roll each kind of dice and stuff) and then itll say like “Jonathan rolled a d20 and got a 12” in a specific channel in discord

10
could also keep track of health and stuff like that but thatd be more complicated

10
why is coding stuff complicated

10

09
EW

09
a screenshot of the theme youre using looks very weird inside of the theme youre using

09
Looks like engineering paper

09
yh

09
its cool

09
but

09
Also whomst said my name, I know one of you did

09
like at the sides

09
?

09
thats dark grey on light grey!

09
what

09

https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/539106814697013250/570817972323614761/unknown.png

09
Isa said my name

09
that looks badddd

09
its not that bad

09
and like

09
wat nooo

09
why does it have lines in the background?

09
because it l o o k s g o o d

09
c r a z y

09
and i can barely read anything!

09
I’m not dumb I saw it Isa

09
that looks big bad

09
i do wish it had less vignette

09
also jok ur opinion is invalid

09
all im saying is that i def wouldnt use it

09
Vinegar

09
I never implied that you are a dumb, nate

09
you can use it

09
Well i saw you say my name

09
(as long as you sign this giant document, in which it definitely doesnt say your mom is gay)

09
why does your name

09
it was in suggestions

09
but it wasnt a suggestion

09
so

09
i delet

09
Yeah no duh I'm just being a dumb

09
Why does my name?

09
Yes

09
Because I’m god

09
No

09
Because I'm very sure you r not my dad

09
(he is in our dnd campaign)

09
Ok you got me

09
wait what

09
I’m an intern

09
nah my headcannon is that you're a student making a project thats gonna get a b

09

https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/539106814697013250/570818910371315743/Screenshot_20190424

09
I am jesus

09
Nice cropping

09
According to Google

09
Jonk what?

09
yeah what

09
Oh no not a b

09
nates a student at god school and this is a project hes doing

09
Makes sense

09
and so far its looking like a b

09
(nah jklol)

09
No more like a c+

09
It’s not my fault that the simulator simulates idiots

09
mAN i REALLY WISH 90% OF BD THEMES WERENT *fUCKING ANIME*

09
i have found sO man themes that look pretty good but then wHOOPS THE BACKGROUND IMAGE IS AN ANIME

09
BACKGROUND IMAGE =/= GOOD UNLESS ITS SIMPLISTIC

09
yeah see why is the default theme so bad?

09
like

09
Are the other 10 less censored anime?

09
okok that doesnt make sense

09
what

09
lemme restart

09
like yeah, see? why are you looking for more themes? is there a reason you don't like the default one or do you just want something different?

09
default one is boring

09
and the one i normally use

09


09


09
klol

09
ids how the default one is boring tho

09
i mean

09
i guess its *simple* if thats what you mean

09
its not very interesting

09
its like

09
too complex to be minimalist or modern

09
but also not complex enough to be super good looking

09
the one i just showed u (the light theme) is complex in a good way (though as i said i wish there wasnt vignette)

09
and the one I used to use

09
yeah the thing with your theme is that



but im not saying that you shouldn't use it or anything, just saying its not to my taste

09
it simplistic and minimalist

09
the one you used to use?

09
also I can make the text not red

09
i just did lol

09
Night yalls

09
nite

09
the GREEN text is what looked real bad

09
literally could barely read it lol

09
oo o o f

09
but yeah i think the current discord theme is fine

09
like

09
its lame xd

09
it conveys just enough information at a glance

09
what

09
the theme

09
no theme conveys less or more information than the normal one

09
themes dont change content

09
(well wait yeah hang on)

09
mk lol

09
i have kinda dumb

09
but yeah i mean

10
okok what i think might look nice is like the normal discord theme but with the lines that yours has in a dark grey, a bit darker than the normal bg

07
no im jusrt really bad at typing fast without typos

07
if you had said "yeah see" it would be fine but when you say it like that its like you're* saying you did it just to feel better than us

07
you actually cannot make me fucking believe you mistyped "steam" as "treem" and "spore" as "trore"

07
and yet i did

07
maybe just fucking dont

07
its annoying as hell and its actually harder to mess that up than get it right

07
i mean why is it that bad?

07
also pretty hard to "accidentally" make both "typos" start with the same letters?

07
youve done it a couple times and every time you do it i get more annoyed

07
301+

07

07
back when every video would get stuck at 301+?

07

what are you talking about

07
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIkhgagvrjI

07
do you not remember this?

07
not the vid

07
but just the thing

07
no wtf

07
i do not

07
where every popular video would get stuck at 301+ views for a few hours

07
jeez dude

07

07
that was on like

07
every video

07
that it happened

07
never noticed

07
like

07
also that still doesnt explain the 391 views thing unless it was like a massively popular video but you didnt provide context so it just makes no sense

07
301

07
that was up to 2015

07
y e a h i g o t i t

07
it doesnt explain ur image

07
301 views

07
on just a random video

07
because in order for it to be a joke itd have to be a popular vid

07
idk

07
i just thought it was funny

07
but since its just nondescript 301 views it xould be literally any vid

07
prolly just naturally has 301 views

07
ok this is dumb

07
*this* is why i don't respond to you guys xd

03
thats small as fucc boii

03
basically

03
marijuana recreationally legal in NM soon?

03
*dont*

03
/s

03
dud cannabis is like

03
the least bad of all drug

03
literally not as bad as smoking or vaping

03
(but still p bad because drug bad)

03
idk man

03
marijuana safest drug

03
change my mind

03
caffeine

03
ok caffeine doesnt count unless ur like fuccin snorting pure caffiene powder

03
yeah see

03
its a drug

03
BUT

03
also marijuana might be less addictive then caffiene

03
so

03
¯\_(ツ)_/¯

03
it's so safe that ppl are fine with it

03
and yeah it kinda is

03
what

03
(more addictive than w e e d)

03
yeah i said *might*

03
and then just gogled it

03
i was incorrect

03
how addictive *is* it anyway?

03
other than caffiene bcuz thats such a like widely used safe one

03
marijuana?

03
ye

03
9% of all users are physically addicted

03
basically v e r y s m o l

03
vs caffine?

03
because a LOT of ppl are addicted to caffine

03

https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/539106814697013250/575803229191929856/unknown.png

03
yeah but not like physically addicted i dont think

03
okokokok hold up

03
literally

03

https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/539106814697013250/575803345231413248/unknown.png

03
caffine has withdrawl and negative effects and stuff

03
how is it 'not addictive'

03
oh hey that was only one thing

03
article has

03
'on the flip side...'

03
one sec

03

https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/539106814697013250/575803536512909350/unknown.png

03
o fugg

03
yeah

03
like

03
"don't talk to me until i've had my coffee"

03
is just

03
ok so like

03
50% addiction rate

03
about

03
is what im getting

03
"without caffine i can't function as a human being"

03
9% < 50%

03
but yeah caffine is dumb

03
so i was r i g h t haha

03
like it doesn't even substitute for sleep

03
ok the point im trying to make is not caffiene bad i think we already knew that

03
drinking coffee to make up for lost sleep is like taking pain medicine for a broken leg

03
my point is marijuana good

03
or at least better

03
well

03
ok yeah but thats just because caffine SUCK

04

04
lung cancer also very bad

04
so

04
edible

04
lol have you seen that tifu post about that guy that ate like 3 weed cookies when the serving size was half a cookie

04
no lmao

04
sounds like big oof tho

04
and then he had to go to a dinner with his parents while he was absolutely out of it

04
yike

04
i mean

04
marijuana makes u ghungry so

04
better have been a big dinner xd

04
i like this kind of argument

04
its not like

04
opinion v opinion

04
and neither of us are super emotionally attatched to being right

04
so

04
f a c t

04
yeah because opinion v opinion arguments are stupid

04
wow how could you say that

04
like, what are you gonna accomplish

04
that opinnion is bad

04
UH OH

04
lmao

04
opinion wrong

04
ur opinion is wrong

04
mine right

04

04
yu wanna du somin

04
im board

11
Dude if weed was legal in NM I would fucking perfect that shit, brownies, nicrome chambers, all of it

10
Boy you already know that's why DC is better

10
guess ill move back

03
ok idk why i find this so funny and you guys probably wont find it funny but im recording voice lines for drivers ed project and every time i mess up i listen back on it and i just get the most *passive agressive fucking voice on the planet*

03
like i soudn so goddamn annoyed and its hilarious

03
oKAY NEW FUN GAME

03
take every time i mess up a line and line them up so you just here like 4 of me talking and then they gradually fall out with something like "oh my god.."

04
Yeah see if I perfected it fully I’d sell it not get high off it

04
Science is the way to money

04
But yeah brownies I would totally do

04
u mean perfected as in perfect dosage not highest dosage yes

04
also yeah weed brownee or cookee best way to drug

04
See if you get it right you could actually make a batter as opposed to a dough

04
what

04
w e e d  c a k e

04
Weed brownies in their unbaked form is a dough

04
Not a batter like normal brownies

04
only real reason to use math in real life: finding out how much marijuana to put in your weed brownies

04
also nate no?

04
you just use like brownie mix or something but instead of using vegetable oil with the brownie mix use cannabis oil

04
Isaiah told me that and he’s a drug head so

04
well first of all why are you listening to isaiah

04
also you could still be right my way is only one way to do it lol

04
Yeah

04
The reason why it goes in brownies is because in brownies the taster of chocolate is strong, weed tastes like absolute shot

04
Also yeah I did try to tell him that if you did it right then you could have a batter

04
yeah

04
but i mean

04
as mentioned in the video im making xd you can put it in tons of stuff

04
aw fugg

04
oh

04
You could make weed tomato soup and grilled cheese if you got good soup

04

Also shut the hell up Walter you like fire trucks and moster trucks

03
walter

03
ok this is way too long

03
is good or is bad??

03
From what perspective

03
like your opinion

03
its students complaining about LAHS

03
and pointing out the b a d

03
did you post because good or post because bad

03
Good

03
alrighty

03
Yooo the last thesis

03
Gogem dood

03
frieken rotate

03
ok some criticisms of this

03
It’s not mine btw

03
some parts sound almost like just a failing student thats like "oh you guys pay more attention to A students or ppl with better grades than me so im gonna write up a whole 95 things that are complaints of the school"

03
no

03
like some parts just paint A students in a bad light

03
and thats dumb

03
die

03
ok

03
and some parts sound e x t r e m e l y pretentious

03
they coulda said some things nicer/better

03
One thing I find is that they pay too much attention to the good students

03
well yeah sure thats valid

03
but they way they worded some stuff just soudns like "REE I DONT HAVE GOOD GRADES AND HE DOES SO BASICALLY HES BAD"

03
the point theyre trying to make is valid but they way they make it is sorta iffy

03
For 77/78, anyone who sends a sick student to school is a threat to public health and should be treated as such.
Toaster makes some valid points.
The document makes a lot of valid points.

04
o

05
Also if a teacher pays attention to a better student it’s probably because the bad student is well, bad. I mean they actually would do their job for students that want their help not students that think that the teacher will just help them because they have a bad grade

05
imagine a world where everything is the same except air resistance is really high

07
i just saw this and that would be lit

07
you could fly by swimming

07
yes

07
but also itd be hard to move

07
thats sorta a cool game concept

07
instead of like controlling gravity

07
you control air resistance

07
c o o l v r g a m e

07
AND YOU MOVE BY SWIMMING

07
that would be LIT

07
yeah thats what i just said xd

07
fuck you

07
I had a dumb idea, a world where the idea of music doesn’t exist but they get our music videos at random times and think it’s a warning of the future.

09
thanks walter

11
Ok so on the last page

11
I would say that the school doesn’t just suck at solving mental health issues, LAPS as a whole has an issue where they try to solve the symptoms not the underlying problem, this goes for literally every problem they try to fix

11
still speaking about the 95

11
Yes

11
because most of it actually sounds like a persons friend group is all of the sources

11
Yeah I picked up on that too

11
The argument is very focused on 2 things, (1 if you think about it) homework and mental health.

11
plus the fact that the person who wrote the paper doesn't acknowledge the fact that mental illnesses can actually be genetic and are not just caused by school i mean it can actually happen but its not that common that it should be a main concern to a HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT

11
stress is not a mental illness i would also like to point out

11
I do agree with their points about Saturday school and such, if you check into Saturday school you aren’t allowed to leave until 3

11
Which is bull

11
What if they only have like one thing to do

11
yes it really is
also the mental health thing is not just in LAHS it is actually in many schools, some students that have dyslexia, ADHD, etc might not get diagnosed until they are in their senior year of high school, plus even then some don't get diagnosed until even later, as an example my mom's co
ok now i'm done

11
You missed my point

11
one more thing the last one isnt even a complaint it is more of a blackmail if you ask me

11
but what was your point

11
We are trying to steer away from just mental health, the issue is that LAPS sucks at solving any kind of issue, they dish out painkillers and bandaids when you get shot, but don’t fix the issue, just the problems that arise from it.

11
what the hell

11
when ever go down there they chuck an ice pack at me

11
(it causes more pain for me)

11
Still missing the point, imagine if you had a leak in your cars gas tank, well the way that the school would fix that is to just keep adding gas so that you have enough

11
They don’t patch the hole, they just add more and more gas, all the while the hole gets bigger

11
dude i saw what you were saying i just was like yess i can make a joke about spraining my wrist and them toughing an ice pack at me

11
Oh

11
It didn’t come across that way

11
this is a text chat do you know how hard it is to convey sarcasm like this

11
Yeah

11
You talk too much, @Vlalkosei. You just advanced to level 4.

11
i was mainly saying that the person is making valid points but only on stuff that is valid to them not to everyone else and either way it seems like they are also the kind of person to blame the school for everything i mean if we go back to the attention thing the student is complaining about not being able to get all the attention from the teacher, so it sounds like they are just expecting the teacher to come to them rather than the student go to the teacher (like normal people who want help) but rather the teacher is psychically attuned to the person and only that person so they always know when they need help

Get
Out
Of
The
Clouds
Kids

11
Yes they are malinformed, this is why if wish I knew who they were, so I could help them refine their argument

11
that would be good, also get better sources than the friend group

08
very proud of you zeke

01
i mean you can customize pretty much anything about chrome or brave too

01
extensions/themes exist

01
isnt oprera older than you?

01
yes

01
ok gtg for real now

01
basically b r a v e g o o d

01
where you going?

01
colunteering to help racers

01
giving tired ppl water

01
@JONKKKK maybe, so?

01
i will slam you against a table

01
yeah what he said

01
Why?

01
nah jk

01
Also what about Opera being old?

01
but i mean it seems like it would be slow

01
Nah.

01
unless they're still updating it

01
OOF COURSE THEY ARE

01
Why would they not be?

01
because old things tend to not be updated

01
but you proved me wrong so ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

01
Like chrome or Firefox, Opera is an old, respected browser.

01
They stay that way by being updated regularly.

01
i was thinking that it would be old and outdated but if they're still updating it but i guess thats not the case

01
quick someone recommend a good browser

01
Opera

01
You talk too much, @Alterae. You just advanced to level 7.

01
Or firefox

01
Or maybe brave?

01
i will slam you against a table

01
Or do Microsoft a favor and test out Edge Beta, based on Chromium.

01
vivaldi is nice if you wanna be weird

01
Basically any browser but IE or Chrome.

01
IE?

01
internet explorer

01
Internut Exploder

01
ah

So either an execution or a gangbang

07
Hahahahahahahaha

07
About halfway

07
I sent it as a meme cuz Isa is being big dumdum

07
Everyone who is reading this: We need y’all to meet at some point in a large room. We will blindfold Isa and send her around the room with her arms out. Whoever she touches first will have to make out with her for 3 minutes. Who’s down? Guys and girls included.

07
It’s not meant to be taken seriously

07
Did she ask for a dare too?

07
Yes

07
Kind of

I'm +10 dumb

08
Yes

08
You talk too much, @Blanxy. You just advanced to level 10.

08
You are

08
Thanks

08
Pog you easy clap

08
Wat

08
My son (14) watches a lot of video game streamers on Twitch.tv. I personally don't find them entertaining but I can understand why some people (like my son) do. Over the past month he's starting using terms like "pog", "jabaited", and "Kappa" which I guess are terms that are used in the scope of Twitch.

I don't have an issue with my son using these terms but it's gotten to the point where every sentence is Twitchspeak. We were having dinner and my daughter (age 12) was talking about how she got accepted for a summer program with the local animal shelter, and my son said "Pog you, easy clap". I told him that it was getting out of hand and that he would have to communicate normally to his parents and family. To that he said "Weird champ, feels weird man, normies omega LOL." Until he learns to communicate like a normal human being I've blacklisted Twitch from the internet for the time being. He's hysterical now but I told him that I would unblacklist it if he stopped using twitchspeak, but he's refusing to stop so for now it's banned.

walter is a walter no no u

12
On the contrary, good sir:  It is clear that you are in fact referring to yourself with that statement.
Henceforth, you are forbidden from returning, reflecting, or retaliating to this statement in any way, shape, or form at any point in the future.

12
i already said no no u

12
that was a no u

12
so

12
youre wrong basically

12
BUt I didn't say no u.

12
you did

12
just in a different form

12
still counts

12
depends on what you define as a no u.
I never specifically said "no u".
So I can win this debate if we get lawyery.

@EPIC GAMERS @COOL KIDS @BIG BEOBLE AND WHOEVER ELSE

11
d

11
we shold all minecraft

11
smp fun

11
we need l o t s o f ppl pls

11
why lol

11
because more ppl = more fun

11
thats how mafia works

11
why do you wanna do this so much all of a sudden?

11
God I hate humidity

11
cuz ive been binging callmecarsonlive videos

11
also yes nate correct humidity bad

11
Also yeah didn’t you say mc wasn’t fun

11
unless its cold

11
yeah you dont even like mc

11
living in VA hurt my soul

11
And also you said that after I posted a video of the same caliber

11
MC gets boring if its just everyone doing their own thing and just not interacting but if u got like at *least* 5 ppl on a server who consistently play and have an actual community like carsons server does where theyre all like messing with each other and they have a goddamn pretend police force and stuff then its very very entertaining

11
pee pee brain

11
*wrong* thot

11
shutup walter ur mom is a mom

11
carsons server is like ideal bcuz its a lot of ppl who all know each other

11
*wrong* thot

11
for the most part at least

11
what is that even responding to

11
ohhhh

11
know

11
and also you wouldnt even keep it up

11
WDYM

11
the server

11
i kept that server up 24/7 for an entire week but you nerds just stopped existing on it

11
the only reason its not up right now is because i restarted my comp and forgot to turn it back on

11
because you guys arent playing on it and asking me to

11
i also think terraria could be fun with like 5 ppl

11
but terraria servers are kinda hard

11
maybe

11
i will slam you against a table

11
not saying it has to be MC

11
and it could be expert mode because more ppl = more easy

11
or not

11
just any sandbox survival game with a ton of ppl would be really fun

11
but i still think it would be fun

11
MC is something that everyone already has

11
not everyone has terraria

11
Yeah ok

11
It just weirded me out that you changed your mind

11
i mean almost all of us have it

11
like

11
You’re often a stubborn bastard

11
just MC by itself is pretty boring

11
not v interesting

11
I have more terraria than mc.

11
gets boring fast

11
but with a ton of ppl

11
well

11
ANY game with a ton of ppl would be really fun

11
terraria gets boring less fast

11
false

11
i mean

11
terraria gets grindy faster

11
*ish*

11
my point is

11
but mc is also really grindy

11
Also that’s one of the reasons I wanted to do MC at one point with you guys because the teen center server is really fun

11
i still think we should try a terraria server

11
haha you guys saw nothing

11
literally any game gets more fun the more ppl you have

11
like there are a couple where it might just add more clutter and get harder

11
but the majority of games get more fun when you have more ppl

11
Yup.

11
ok this is how i see it

11
Like Space Engineers, where if you have enough people you can do big space battles.

11
there are like a million mc smps

11
yeah and theyre all really fun

11
but there arent too many terraria smps

11
for the most part

11
idk man im not that into terraria

11
not being able to build in that extra dimension takes something out of it for me for some reason

11
i mean we never get that far in

11
plus theres like no automation

11
Ding dong your opinion is wrong, Jonathan is bad so this song is long, so let’s all gather and sing this song for jonks opinion is totally wrong

11
Jonk is wrong.

11
yeah that part sucks

11
like even just that small aspect of automation that we do in MC makes it that much better

11
how am i wrong?

11
but the only 2d building is just

11
meh

11
not as good

11
i like 2d building a bit better

11
idk why

11
im just better at it

11
cuz its easier so it dont require skill

11
thats why xd

11
Terraria is way less good than the lords game

11
Besides jonk

11
im not saying terraria is better

11
terrarias almost less of a sandbox and more of a like "here upgrade ur armor so you can fight this boss and progress" to me

11
but we've tried mc smps before and we always get kinda bored

11
its not as focussed on building

11
its way more fighting

11
and im saying we should try a terraria smp

11
cuz every mcsmp we do is like 4 ppl

11
but what if we didnt

11
walter is right

11
You’re the one who kills it jonk

11
no??

11
Yeah what’s an smp

11
Also yes

11
survival multiplayer

11
no i dont

11
survival multyplayer

11
i play more than you guys if anything

11
how did this convo do a total 180 from berating me to berating jonathan

11
not complaining but

11
also jok not rly

11
u play like a bit right at the start but then asi it goes on ur more and more like "naahhhh i dont rly wanna"

11
Everyone is fine and then you stop playing and we all get bored because of it and also bullshit you leave in like a matter of hours

11
getting like everyone in this discord server to get on an smp would be fun

11
obv couldnt get every single person

11
but having that amount of ppl would be great

11
last time we played you guys all left and i stayed for a few more hours

11
do u mean like

11
how i had to go to sleep

11
also AGAIN

11
YOU PLAY FINE AT THE START AND DO PLENTY

11
AND THEN JUST STOP

11
all im saying is i dont do that with terraria

11
you go from *that* (playing longer than us) to saying "nah i dont feel like it" whenever we ask you

11
idk why but that happens less with terraria

11
i think jonathan just shouldnt exist as part of this friend group

11
im repromoting nate to epic gamer and demoting jonathan to cool kid

11
why do you guys all hate me?

11
we dont..?

11
u just like very different things

11
"i think jonathan just shouldnt exist as part of this friend group"

11
conflicting interests are not good

11
the majority of your contributions to us playing stuff is "nah i dont wanna"

11
i mean ive been playing more recently...

11
would you like to enjoy a game of











with me

11
i mean ill play mc

11
ok ive been saying "i mean" a lot lol

11
then lets get more ppl and start an smp

11
conversation solved

11
we already started an smp

11
well

11
we shouldn't restart

11
then lets add more ppl to the smp

11
ok

11
so now who *else* wants to play

11
@EPIC GAMERS @BIG BEOBLE

11
@SMOL CHILDREN

11
I don't have mc...
Well, I have on my phone, but Idk if that counts.

11
i would but can’t

11
gotta pack for two trips today

11
yeah ill play if other people do

11
and maybe if they dont?

11
i will slam you against a table

11
idk

11
Are y'all doing Java edition?

11
ye

11
aka good edition xd

11
fuck you

11
ok but in bedrock you cant do the 1

11
well yeah

11
java only good edition

11
I haven't got java...

11
I should buy it.

11
you should dont

11
you have terraria tho right?

11
ok gtg on a bike ride xdddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddd im dying

11
fuck you

11
fuck u too walter

11
yo'er a poo poo head

11
no u

11
I do have terraria.

11
But mods might be an oof.

11
yeah no mods

11
mods gay xd

11
fuck you

11
yeah ill play modded terraria happily

11
And I could prolly buy MC in very near future.

11
ok cya

11
Terraria Overhaul is great

11
modded MC smp would also be fun but MC mods actually affect performance

11
so

11
terraria mods affect performance a bit too

11
installing terraria mods isnt gonna make ur game crash like MC mods can

11
wont noticably effect it

11
yeah but im p sure i couldnt play too many mods on my old comp

11
effect/affect

11
the first was wrong, second was right

11
shudup xd

11
fuck you

11
wait wait no

11
second was wrong

11
yeah terraria modded would be better than vanilla

11
vanilla is still fun tho

11
mc modded would also be better but thats more of an oof for bad pcs

11
vanilla terraria is a lot of fighting and building takes like a sidestage to the fighting but MC is building and building = good

11
well modded terraria is also fighting but

11
it makes it more unknown so more interesting

11
already know what to expect from vanilla

11
i mean its not like you cant build in terraria

11
its still kinda fun

11
yeah but its not as good as in MC and it definitely is not the main focus of the game

11
yeah, i agree

11
MC is more like "hey look at all these really cool things you can build and make and automate but also you could fight if you *want* to"

11
terraria is the opposite

11
ok my opinion:

11
minecraft is too build focused, terraria is too fight focused

11
"hey look at all these really cool things you can fight and defeat and progress towards but also you could build if you *want* to"

11
and i like that better if im being honest

11
which

11
fight?

11
second one

11
sooooooooooooooooooooooo why dont u like normal fighting games

11
i *kinda* do

11
nidhogg, csgo, literally any fighting game

11
smash is p fun now that im getting better at it

11
also splatoon is great

11
yEAH SEE ITS ALMOST LIKE I WAS RIGHT

11
WOW

11
?

11
i always told u if u just put in the time to get better at games like csgo or brawl or scpsl youd enjoy then more\

11
and its CORRECT

11
because ur doing that with smash

11
well yeah

11
i never said you were wrong

11
just dump that time into games that this friend group plays and then youre golden

11
its just that csgo isnt fun to get good at

11
smash isnt either

11
smash is so boring to get good at

11
ehh

11
i disagree

11
just boring fighting over and over and over again

11
its a good party game

11
how boring

11
and useless

11
ok i gtg

11
finally

11
/s

12
"just boring fighting over and over and over again" says the person who loves duck game and stick fight

12
for once I agree with johnothan splatoon and smash are really fun

12
toaster is just mad because its nintendo

12
and not on pc

12
(it totally should be tho)

12
o rly? why

12
bc then you wouldnt have to buy a $300 system

12
and nintendo would have to compete with other games on the platform

12
yeah I guess you're right

01
@Toaster is the server up?

01
the mc server?

01
its not >:((

02
but yeah smash is actually fun to get better at

02
in my opinion because you can see what all players do, you can see where you're lacking and improve those areas

02
but when I played csgo with toaster it was like alright time to do thi

02
plus smash fits multiple play styles that arent shooting

02
https://youtu.be/dNUdbi5ive0

04
my oculus rift sensor wasnt working and i was scared for a second

04
then i just whacked it

04
and now it works

04
good ol percussive maintenance

05
@Shrooms i wasnt actually stating my opinion with the whole "wow smash is bad" thing

05
i was just showing jonathan that wow you can say that about any game

05
and @Zildin playing against me in a game is not a good way to learn how to play said game

05
well this is how i see it

05
smash has a singleplayer mode where the difficulty is customizable

05
so does brawl

05
so you can slowly ramp it up

05
it does?

05
mhm

05
so does csgo

05
bots dont count

05
they do

05
whatre you playing against in smash then?

05
not in my opinion

05
nothing?

05
toaster you’re pretty much the only one i’ve played against without lag. i’ve tried online but it’s so slow i can’t do shit

05
thats not my fault

05
in fact it’s pretty slow a lot whenever i play

05
thats on you/your internet

05
well its bots but you set the difficulty with a number like 3.2 or something and the difficulty slowly ramps up

05
it’s not but playing against you is normal speed.

05
but it’s also you

05
csgo is pretty bad when it comes to those things tho ive had a lot of difficulties with it

05
its not me?

05
what?

05
playing with me does not make your internet better

05
yeah jonathan

05
ok how about we all just stop arguing and play some mc

05
brawl and cs both have those

05
i mean it kinda does

05
they do?

05
also it’s not the internet

05
it’s the comp

05
not as many difficulty options but

05
what

05
connor

05
ok but wtv

05
my computer is slow

05
what the fuck are you talking about

05
not the internet

05
you mean 1v1ing is faster

05
because less ppl

05
yes

05
1v1 servers exist

05
this is a thing that exists

05
where?

05
what

05
I never load up the game unless i’m gonna play with friends because I see no need to

05
lemme just go to my favorited servers real quick

05
hey toaster you should boot up the mc server

05

https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/539106814697013250/584529047187619871/unknown.png

05
ok?

05
(or boot up a terraria server *hint hint nudge nudge*)

05
the majority of those are surf or 1v1 servers

05
but yeah we should play

05
wait connor do you have terraria?

05
but on a 1v1 server i could get paired with someone either  worse making it more annoying to find a good player or someone better making it seem like a huge chore to play the game i’ve barely played

05
and yeah

05
i have it

05
1v1 servers are almost garaunteed to have ppl better than you

05
100%

05
download a practice map or 5 and then p r a c t i c e

05
with who?

05
wait toaster do you know how to host a terraria server?

05
the wall?

05
Bots dum dum

05
if I’ve learned one thing about bots in competitive games it’s that they’re not too good at the game

05
even at higher difficulties

05
how many difficulty settings are there?

05
practice maps arent bots

05
its like

05
"peek this hard angle on a target moving on tracks"

05
*p r a c t i c e*

05
ok but

05
lets

05
do

05
stufffff

05
i would but if it’s something i don’t find enjoyable i will quit rather quickly

05
but how many difficulty settings are in csgo for boys

05
*bots

05
fucking autocorrect

06
oh no its still doing it

06
goddamn my internet just shat itself

06
ok

06
im back

06
i exist

06
i think

06
is the server up?

06
yeah but probably not the world u want

06
chang it !!

06
no

06
what are you playing tho?

06
minecraft

06
no but

06


06
like what in mc

06
14.2

06


06
that didnt work

06
why cant you do more than one underscore?

06
ok wtv

06
what world is the server on?

06
the one i made at the teen center today

06
aaaaaaggghhhhhhhhhh

06
i liked the other world ;

06
well then u shoulda played on it

06
u gonna join or should i stop expecting something that wont come

06
i mean

06
i spent like 5 hours on that world

06
no matter what the world was prolly gonna restart

06
yeah and this one will too

06
might even restart this one too if we get more ppl to agree to play

06
YEAH SEE

06
IM NOT PLAYING ON IT IF YOURE JUST GONNA RESTART IT

06
you have dumb

06
im gonna restart this world if we get a lot of ppl to play

06
no

06
why

06
why do you need to restart when we get more ppl

06
i get it if we're like 30 hours in

06
but you really couldnt have made that much progress

06
cuz as of now only 3 ppl have played on it (rly only 2) so if we get a ton more ppl then just start a new one so were all level

06
oh god my internet

06
i also just like this one bcuz it has fancy scoreboards i made 😄

06
like on the side?

06
yes that is correct

06
you should make a way to toggle it for each person

06
uh but how bout no

06
because i personally dont like it on the side

06
it just clutters stuff a bit

06
oh no now instead of 1 thing on my hud it has ***2*** things

06
whatever shall i do

06
im almost at 1.5k blocks of stone mined

06
yeah i like the scoerboards cuz they add some sense of competition even if its dumb competition

06
ok but whats weird about that

06
at least for me they do

06
1.5k blocks is only a 12x12x12 space

06
yeah but ive only been playing on this world for like <4 hrs

06
*less* than that even

06
yeah im not saying you didnt mine a lot

06
im just saying its weird that 1.5k blocks is only 12x12x12

06
u should join and just observe my stats xd

06
or 12x5x25

06
im on top of every leaderboard but deaths

06
no thanks

06
ill take your word for it

06
ur the one who wanted to play MC my guy

06
well yeah

06
but i wanted to play on the other world

06
i dont wanna spend 5 hours getting back to where i was

06
so youll only play on a world every like week

06
sounds good very fun

06
no?

06
i just like the part once we get 5+hours in

06
this is the current trend im getting

06
bcuz you play for like 5 hours and then just *stop* and then whenever i change the world to a new one SO MAYBE YOUD PLAY FOR ANOTHER 5 HOURS ur like "but i wanted the other oneeeeee"

06
i will slam you against a table

06
well ok

06
you didnt play on it either

06
if you were on and asked me to join i would GLADLY play

06
bcuz nobody else was and i dont enjoy solo MC after a specific point

06
well you couldve asked to play

06
so youd rather that i went back to spamming you with @s until you play

06
im trying to *not* do that jonathan

06
no dont spam

06
im not gonna beg you to play every time im on

06
just

06
do "@JONKKKK wanna play mc?"

06
or or or

06
how bout

06
you just join the server

06
rn?

06
maybe notice when it says *playing **minecraft*** below my name and join

06
i will slam you against a table

06
toaster just *ask*

06
you're putting all the pressure on me to notice when you're playing instead of just asking

06
hey you know what i bet smps like carsons and also literally every other one do



not ask ppl to play they just get on

06
alright

06
ill play

06
***if***

06
you dont reset the world

06
no promises

06
just enjoy the world how it is and then if we get a ton more ppl

06
i might reset

06
maybe i wont

06
i will slam you against a table

07
am back

what project do

06



06
like

06
just results?

06
or actual theoretical gameplay?

06
here is one round of one game of what that very long file does (all random number gen right now, not taking into account ranks or anything)
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/539106814697013250/589613032657911828/image0.jpg

06
how do you kill while defusing?

06
alright

06
lmao big brain

06
im dumb

06
dont mind me

06
but yeah itll do whole games and then loop back and keep stats

06
you can easily change timing on how long a “second” of a round takes, the delay between rounds restarting, and the delay between games

06

06
like

06
prolly

06
u could prolly do it with any game rly

Match start!
the enemy team took the tower and is in the lead!
they lost the tower!
the enemies score is now 93.
we took the tower!

our score is now 65.

etc.

06
something like that

its a bit complicated (obv lol, i think accurately simulating any game is difficult and its just made harder with how much strategy is put into csgo) but i think i have a good start and once i get home i can start making it a lot better

06
oo oo try simulating 1v1s

06
actually wait that would just be

player 1 killed player 2!
player 2 killed player 1!
player 2 killed player 1!
player 1 killed player 2!
player 2 killed player 1!
player 1 killed player 2!
player 1 killed player 2!
player 2 killed player 1!

06
i mean thats just kinda like higher rank or higher hrs on 1v1 maps/servers wins

06
coild even just let it be random but

06
i mean what else would it be in lower ranks?

06
reaction time i guess but u cant rly get that easily with python lol

06
or aim

06
but again cant rly get it

06
unless you have a bomb or something ittl just be kills

06
yeah

06
ok yeah that was what i was saying

06
yeah thats the only thing is i cant get reaction time or aim so i just have to kinda correlate hours to aim/better reaction time

06
obv it wont be 100% accurate but its a fun project

06
wait so whats going on in the bg?

06
wot

06
because it cant just be printing out strings at random

06
oh no yeah thats why its 300 lines long lol

06
is it actually simulating positions and stuff?

06
no but i do plan on that (very roughly, probably just like ct, t, mid, a, b)

06
its really just all random right now

06
so why is it 300 lines?

06
every second it gens a random number (which will generally increase in value as time goes on, but it is random so no guarantee) and if the number is > 5 it says “ok an action is happening” and then does a random num for if its a kill or bomb plant/defuse etc etc

the reason its 300 lines long (could probably be about 200) is mainly bcuz i copy pasted a big chunk of it bcus i was too lazy to make it all dynamic so i just ctrl

06
alrighty

06
but its mainly a lot of math for the bomb defusing, i think thats the biggest part (and also the one i copied xd)

06
lol

06
also you know the amazing world of gumball?

06
ok that was off topic

06
but still

06
it ended

06
oh no

06
on a cliffhanger tho

06
like

06
ok but back on topic xd

06
this is half of the bomb code (only for CT)

06
ok yeah

06
oh fuck thats a lot of tabs

06
how can you see my screen?

06
/s

06
ok that sorta helped on the beginning

06
im too lazy to do it for the rest lol

06
wait

06
there

06
i have no idea what you are talking about

06
oh wait does it not show the code blocks for you?

06

it keeps saying "Your message could not be delivered because you don't share a server with the recipient or you disabled direct messages on your shared server, recipient is only accepting direct messages from friends, or you were blocked by the recipient."

07
ill dm it to you?

07
it might be more than 2000 chars

07
```py
    if bomb == "planted":
        if yourTeam == "CT": # If you are on CT:
            defuseChance = randint(0, 5)
            if defuseChance == 0: # If the chance you defuse it is 0
                message = "Enemy killed Team (While defusing)"
                team
                # You lose```

07
it sends that much wtf

07
i dont think so

07
yeah no its 1,858

07
```    if bomb == "planted":
        if yourTeam == "CT": # If you are on CT:
            defuseChance = randint(0, 5)

                message = "Enemy killed Team (While defusing)"
                team
                # You lose
            elif defuseChance == 4: # If the chance you defuse it is 4 (There is one enemy left and you got a nat 5)
                if team == enemies: # If both teams have the same num of ppl:
                    if randint(0, 1) == 0: # Half of the time:
                        message = "Enemy killed Team (While defusing)"
                        team
                        # You lose```

07
```py
    if bomb == "planted":
        if yourTeam == "CT": # If you are on CT:

idfk its just good its like it looks like its from a movie?????

01
IDFK it just be like that

07
you should really clean your screen tho

08
Oh damn... yeah.

02
hey @Toaster is the mc server up and on survival?

02
i think so but not sure

02
is it on 1.14.1 or 2?

02
btw spawn is in NM, my house is at like

02
.2

02
yeet

02
i got bbt by the way

02
wot

02
oh battleblock?

02
why lol

02
he obviously means big bang theory

02
ah yes my bad

02
yeah

02
thats why it ended

02
he bought it

02
and cancelled it

02
ah okay makes perfect sense

02

i get home in

02
i said when *i* get back

02
oh wack

02
big brain

02
u should join jok on my serv so when i get back u guys have started

02
btw /stats and /ustats

02
i mean once you get back ittl inevitably be only a few days before you restart it

02
can u srsly dont

02
it prolly wont bcuz its a good map and i have a good start

03
yeah and ittl be 3 hours before you give up jonk

03
as long as other ppl (you guys) actually keep playing im fine

03
^^^^^^yes nate

03
but on all the other worlds i played for just as long as you guys

03
which is why i dont like it when we restart

03
i will mr blue sky montage you

03
idk man i think its alot more of u kinda stopping and then i restart it cuz nobody’s playing on it and then you go ree

03
what other worlds u even mean lol

03
that ONE other one that we did recently

03
?

03
and the one before that

03
i LOVED that world

03
??

03
the one where i had a chicken farm and the start of an actual base

03
it was just getting good!

03
the one where you lived in a jungle?

03
bruh u stopped playing on that one

03
wait im out of the loop how is it hosted

03
on my comp

03
ip?

03
nvm

03
mk lol

03
just being dum

03
ugh i dont really like this map that much

03
its really rugged

03
just go somewhere else? literally every biome

03
wait, does this world have mushroom biomes?

03
me and quinn walked to antarctica (idfk how but we just kept going south) and most of it was flat

03
probably not

03
so not EVERY biome

03
but yeah ill try

03
scale?

03
1:4000

03
ok every real biome how bout that lol

03
right?

03
yeah

03
so smol boi yes?

03
also does it use the mercator projection?

03
its still pretty big

03
yeah but like smoll boi yes?

03
nate the earth is huge

03
btw the path blocks are “roads” but since there are so many irl roads theyre really train tracks

03
yeah its really big

03
well not like h u g e but it took us like 45 mins to walk from NM through south america to antarctica

03
maybe more like 30

03
but still

03
ok i gtg have fun xd

03
wait

03
when was this map made?

03
1.13 or 1.14?

03
not made generated

03
you know what i mean

03
idk exactly but not 1.14

03
why

03
no bamboo :(

03
ohhh yeah

03
i think you can fish for it tho

03
ok if u find a jungle tell me and ill /give

03
PARROT AA

03
whochever u guys prefer

03
im in a jungle rn

03
u in mexicp?

03
i fucking found white sands and its just fucking white stained clay

03
i think

03
did u cross a cobblestone wall

03
mmhmm

03
u in mexico

03
cobble walls are country borders

03
idk why but i found immense joy in finding where d

03
JESUS CHRIST THATS A LOT OF EGGS

03
jonathan

03
you javemt had any big projects in any of the worlds ove reset

03
ok that actually seemed way more angry than i thought it would lol

03
u havent had any big projects

03
but tbh i dont like the earth maps

03
tbh ur bad xd

03
why not

03
they're out of date

03
what

03
they have old villages and old generation

03
wdym old generation its all custom gen

03
meaning no bamboo, no new villages, etc

03
yeah, but it was generated before those existed

03
which means we'll never have it on those maps

03

02
you are a gay man? idk what the last one is

02
amour is love i think

02
and then the eux must be french

02
because i tried to do

"you are a man lover" because idk what gay is and i wanted it to be mostly my translation

02
ah okay yeha

https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/539106814697013250/590388686311522324/its_raining.mp3

09
it kinda do tho

09
sounds like something from early homestuck kinda

09
LESS tho

09
later into the song it doesnt

09
at least i dont think

09
go to like 0:54

09
ok actually you might be right

09
so instead of a BAD video game song, it sounds like a DECENT video game song

09
yeah still meh

09
what could i do to make it better?

09
(also its really compressed so the instruments all sound bad)

09
sounds like either early homestuck undertale fan game

09
any suggestions tho?

09
make it less meh game bg music

09
how youd do that, idfk

10
but do it xd

10
i mean maybe making it more lofi would help

10
i would add a vinyl crackle but with the rain in the bg thats kinda redundant

An actual story would be better though

I like that idea.

ok but to have a story we have to have a story

11
Explanation for elevator, often in Japan the entrance and exit are on different sides for the efficiency

11
and in some asian countries bathrooms are just holes in the ground

11
but i mean still

11
Toilets are pretty simple, you see Japan actually has things called squatting toilets

11
Not very common in tourist heavy areas

11
Odd

11
yeah it’s fun

11
also anime bs

its a soap ad but it literally just starts with
"you know that soap you use?





its ***shit***"

09
thats literally how it starts

09
he called a mans balls dry, empty, and sad

09
because they were talking about how the chemicals in other soaps cause dry skin and low sperm count

09
that was so fucking weird

09
i am so genuinly confused

10
Card hunter looks like it could be maybe fun @deleted

10

toaster thanks for your support however i regret to inform you that you were not the sole target of this information

02
i feel like sending "SATCHEL AND I JUST BEAT THE ENDER DRAGON" in the general chat channel of a server with 50 ppl kinda doesnt have any implied direction but ok

02
COOL ....what's the ender dragon

02
MC boss boi

02
you dont know what the ender dragon is?

02
the final boss of mc

03
That looks like a burrito

03
Also the ender dragon looks terrifying ***no thank you***

03
meh/10 imo

03
think i like the wither less

03
i have officially accidentally renamed my pickaxe to "diamond pickaxe33"

03
why lol

03
oh

03
i have big brain

03
i tried to put it in the 3rd slot of my inventory twice before realizing you cant in an anvil

03
and i didnt realize i was typing in the name slot

03
so

04
honestly with correct prep the wither can be pretty easy

04
it was probably a bug but when me a friend spawned a wither and trapped it in a small box it just sort of gave up

06
weeeeeeeeeeeeeee should play jackbox @deleted

u see the fade from bottom blocks to top blocks how it fades from like messed up to less messed up

01
does it just do that automatically?

01
oh wait its a mod?

01
think so

01
i thought it was a texture pack

01
i mean youd have to change how mc applies textures but u could do it with a pack

01
well hm

01
resource packs cant change where the textures are applied or how

01
so no it has to be a mod

01
oof

01
aw man its only 1.12.2

01
but yeah it looks decent but not *that* good

01
w d y m

01
it looks crazy good

01
not good enough to justify using older versions

01
yeah it just looks like that one texture pack on xbox

01
it really dont tho

01
like

01
i dont see why you love it so much

01
its p much just an hd texture pack

01
it literally changes the way textures are applied to blocks jonathan

01
how?

01
did you even see the screenshot or the middle part of our conversation

01
so its just that?

01
i bet its a setting but blocks lower down look more beat up and everything is random or connected textures

01
you could get a similar (albeit toned down) effect by mixing blocks

01
yeah but thats stupid and also not nearly as cool

01
i just dont like the look of it and also i like new versions

01
u have bad

06
I'm bored and I wanna play a modpack

06
anyone wanna do something?

08
hey anyone know a good mc texture pack

08
aquamarine

08

08
im trying to think

08
yeah aquamarine is olllld tho

08
1.8

08
thats from like 6 years ago

08
Yeah

08
That doesn’t mean you can’t use it

08
well lots of blocks will be untextured

08
but yeah im not specifically looking for a pvp pack

08
as I suck at pvp

08
It’s not a pvp pack omg

08
But ok

08
its called

08
If you want a nice fancy one then do faithful

08
im pretty sure it says pvp pack but ok

08
"Aquamarine PvP Resource Pack"

08
https://www.planetminecraft.com/texture_pack/aquamarine

08

08
liam

08
what about the new blocks

08
time to obliterate liam

08
They look fine

so I cant use the 1.14.3 in 1.13

https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/539106814697013250/593632843809292328/unknown.png

08
fuckin adfly

08
it doesnt work with 1.13 because you cant play 1.13 on it

08
because it boots up 1.14 and you cant change that without older copies of optifine

08
you can still play 1.13 tho

08
ok the download icon isnt a grass block or the java logo

08
screenshot?

06
jonathan why doesnt this work

06
```py
def on_click(x, y, button, pressed):
    global window
    if pressed:
        file = open("log.txt", "a+")
        if not (GetWindowText(GetForegroundWindow()) == window):
            window = GetWindowText(GetForegroundWindow())
            file.write("\n[Clicked into window '%s']\n" % window)
        else:
            file.write("\n[Mouse %s clicked at (%s, %s), in window '%s']\n" % (button[7:], x, y, window))
        file.close()```

06
the "a+" is wrong

06
it should be a "b

06
what does b stand for then

06
you cant have too high of expectations

06
a = append
w = write
r = read

06
what does b mean

06
that you got an 80

06
YES IT OWOASLDKFJ

06
oh fuck wait

asdf AKSCDXXLKAFSDLKFJ

07
if ur gonna test your program you should do it in the bot channel

07
im not im just spamming because im angri

07
why are you angri*?

07
code no work

07
module big dumb

07
how he brek?

07
module cant take input from keyboard and mouse at the same time because someone thought itd be a good idea to split the listeners into two different ones that you cant use at the same time

07
so i can either record mouse clicks/movements
or record keystrokes

07
just switch between them rlly fast

07
but not both

07
i c a n n o t

07
what are you trying to do?

07
very good keylogger

07
but i cannot

07
and am angri

07
why lol

07
i dont have anything else to do

07
what would you code rn

07
make something that generates random pixels of color

07
and then rate each one

07
and do ai to it

07
bom you haf art maker

07
OR

07
wait lol

07
from that i thought you emant

07
it just generates 1 pixel of solid color

07
and then we get ppl to rate it

07
so we find the b e s t c o l or

07
the subjectively best color

07
oooo

07
hey you know whos a gamer

07

04
"Hopefully fixed bosses bugging out in multiplayer because I hate my life and multiplayer is a bug that shouldn't exist in this universe unless you appreciate making programmers suffer with inescapable depression and anxiety the likes of which you have never witnessed. "

04
well then

"Added more effects to the various spears to make them less boring."
"Changed a few bows and spears"
"Spears that fire projectiles now fire them from the spear tip"
"Nerfed several lore items"

Hey Toaster, How do I get @streamnotifs ?

10
hey fun thing that you apparently dont realize

10
people dont want to be pinged for no reason stop doing @ everyone and just pinging random roles

11
Hey so another dream

11
oh no

11
This one is, part of a like 6 part continuous storyline, but I’ll write down the full story in a doc at some point

11
o h n o

11
Also this story includes real and unreal people

11
So

11
Keep that in mind

11
this is scaring me ngl gamer

11
especially with how wacky dreams are

11
So I’m in an airport (where I think the entire storyline takes place) with alexander, (the cool one) Izzy, and satchel and we’re just wandering around. And I’m sprinting full speed, for no reason, and I sprint down this hallway, which my brain has designated is just a hallway, and there’s a locked door at the end of this hallway at all times, and this time the door leads to an exhibit about creative writing, anyways about 6 feet in front of the locked door, there’s a metal detector, and Alexander sets it off, and there’s a new almost invisible sliding door next to the metal detector, the sliding door turns orange, and opens to an elevator just full of security guards, then one of the security guards asks Alexander what set off the detector. Then he pulls out one of those continuous metal bands that are spiraled together, I think they’re called a toroflux, and he folds it out and it’s a frisbee like thing that spins really fucking fast.

11
The security guard at the front of the elevator says that it’s not allowed past the metal detectors, and the sliding door shuts, then we all sprint full speed back down the hallway, into a main area, then satchel, Alexander, and Izze are all forgotten by my brain and I walk over to the gate I’m supposed to be at, with my family, and again I see a character that is not a real person (I don’t think so) , and is a reoccurring character, my brain has named her wolf girl, I don’t know why she’s there, she just is, and she’s like the wolf version of a cat girl, anyways as my brain works, there is no boarding groups (or I just always miss them?) and the man who boards people calls out names, I go to do something (this part is blanked out) and I return to the gate but it’s almost empty besides my mom, some cognitively engineered friend of my mom, and one quarter of the terminal, my mom asks if I can get on now, and I board, I find a seat near the front and, it turns out that it’s right next to Alexander, then upon turning around, the three people behind me are izze, satchel, and wolf girl. I think I got a selfie with the group? And then it ended.

11
I wanna say that this would make more sense if I gave you the rest of the story, (the first two episodes) but that might confuse you more, basically the premise that I picked up on is that the school has organized a trip to some currently unknown to me location on the east coast, and everyone invited, it’s probably the dream equivalent of Virginia Beach and San Francisco mixed together.

11
w o l f g i r l

11
bois nates dreaming about a wolf girl >v>

11
that was pretty much my only takeaway

11
do u have terraria nate?

11
Yeah I do

11

11
Nah man

11

11
No it just runs like ass, one of the same reasons I’m holding out on playing the mc server too

11
ah yeah understandable

11
still waiting on the new lappertopper i assume

11
It’s all up to my mom now

11
yeah especially with the mods we run i can def see it running even worse lol

11
well just hope u get the luptup soon so u can do more stuff

11
If you really want to psychoanalyse my dream, wolf girl in most continuities is Japanese.

11
oh man lmao

11
But she only exists at the airport and now on a plane

11
She’s only ever appeared in episode 1 and 4

11
i feel like i am underqualified to psychoanalyse anything but uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

11
Ok that’s both advanced and illegal

11
How is it illegal?

11
<18

11
Because I was up at like 3am going down the internet chain, and I found that by accident and it was o d d

11
There is no law against watching porn under 18

11
It's being in a porn film

11
Nope

11
guys north korea is awake

11
O wow

11
Let's nuke em

11
It’s anything involving underages and sexual content, that’s why R rated movies are 18+ requirements too

11
17+

11
You mean

11
Nope

11
I know what I’m talking about man

11
nates is advanced

11
I’m a gamer

11
And if there is a law against watching porn underage why don't I need an Id or something of proof to watch it?

11
Well the internet is hard to enforce that because you can’t just show your id to the camera, really it’s not illegal if you don’t get caught but like don’t rat yourself out either

11
>this entire discord convo

11
>dont rat yourself out

11
>shut up

11
Also R rated is under 17 needs a parent or gaurdian

hey bapy when you wake up i made you armor

01
So the dream itself doesn’t matter, but the character that arose from it does, it’s called the red man, he looks like a skeleton without ribs, and he’s made of red/black smoke, and he has a red painted tin can for a head, the can also has a really badly made smiley face painted on it, he leaves “ads” on scrap metal. The ads vary in design but two elements that always stay the same are the smiley face and a number, 432

01
what if you wish red man to not exist

01
432

I was at the teen center and I saw someone in the reflection of the window in the computer lab so I flipped my head over the seat to look at them, but pulling that off while your face down in your pillow simply lifts your head up and wakes you up.

i just drove from my house to by toasters house and it was mildly terrifying

10
i also drove up the other mesa

10
and i *didnt* die

10
i would say thats an accomplishment

11
the other mesa?

11
Yes.

11
Everyone knows there are only two mesas.

11
No more, no less.

11
like

11
on the other side of the roundabout

12
what

12
you see im a dumb bitch

12
on the way to the middle school/toasters house theres a roundabout

12
yeah

12
and if you go left instead of right theres another mesa

12
ah ok that one

12
i drove main hill once it was fun

12
I’m literally so tired that I can’t get up to get food because I’m too hungry to make my mooscles work

12
yeah that happens

12
Alright here I go

01
i was about to be mad that someone changed the server name but i like this better

02
gauche as piddle

02
(you're welcome)

02
gg

02
what does gauche mean btw

02
like

02
crude

02
poorly made

02
the quote “gauche as shit” is from bojack horseman, and he was using it to describe the great pyramids of egypt

02
pyrmids of giza?

02
forget the name but u get the point

02
@GoldenPot8o are you at TC?

02
if yes could you ask one of the staff:
if i bring some xbox controllers and a wireless adapter for PC, will they let me install the drivers for the adapter on a computer?

02
or they could make it alot easier by just letting us use the ones they have instead of banning em ;;;;))))

02
not there

03
aw

03
also they have controlers and a wireless adapter, and all the computers there have the drivers

03
they just dont let u use the adapters?

03
what no

03
thats for the xbox 1 controlers

03
i have asked if we could get controllers for pc and do a coop game and every time you have told me they dont allow it

03
they dont let u use usb to micro usb because people kept making the cords all beat up

03
so we CAN do wireless xbox 360 controllers with the PCs

03
?

03
I TELL YOU THAT YOU HAVE TO GET YOUR OWN CONTROLER FROM THE FRONT DESK oops caps, because they dont let you check out controlers for other people

03
yes you can

03
bruh you srsly didnt but wtv doesnt matter

03
i know now

03

12
Ooh yeah

12

12
agree

12
Let’s remove all the good shit from soda

12
“Idk man this kinda tastes like static”

12
And then some 40yo mom chugged it and was like mmmmmmmmmmmmmm

12
making things more carbonated makes them shit

like literally any soda is 10x better if you let it sit for a day so it has no carbonation

12
Static

12
carbonation in general is just ass

12
And now I have to deal with red skittle flavored cosmic radiation taking up space in my fucking fridge, because I don’t have any ammo for my co2 rifle

12
I’m gonna build an arsenal of weapons to commit sparkling water genocide

12
im gonna build a weapon that just remove carbonation from every drink you point it at

12
Finally sane people

12
I’m gonna build a high power solar laser and aim it at the space station

12
Wait wait

12
I just had a not so legal idea

12
oh no

12
But maybe like super legal I’m not sure

12
Do you know how gas engines have fuel injector systems

12
I’ll just draw it out

12
A gun cannon sort of thing

12
Ok so

12
*in candance voice* mooomm nate making lethal illegal weaponry again

12
candace

12
Pat the gus in teh burrel to fir out chumber

12
If I got the right size burrel and added more injectors I could use soda cans as shells and then purchase styrofoam and mix with the same gasoline as I’m using in the gas canister to make napalm, then put napalm in the can, fire the can and shoot napalm rounds out of a fucking scrap cannon

12
That’s metal as fuck dude

12

12

01
Wait.

01
d class

01
Nice.

01
i actually wanna work towards class a licence so i can drive anything

01
why

01
you have to take shit tons of classes and tests for every kind of vehicle

01
cant let these haters know my next move

02
unless your gonna be a truck driver when u get older then theres literally no point

02
yeah you dont need a class a to drive tanks and planes are a different license and i cant think of anything else youd want to drive

02
having a standard civi license (class c) is like having a provisional for driving tanks

02
u can drive one if someone with a class h (treaded vehicle) license is in there with you

Can you use barrels as mailboxes

06
Cause you should be able to

06
i mean yeah it works

06
and itd look better then a chest

06
no dont think so

06
i went and replaced urs with a chest xd

06
ill maybe look into it but

06
since ur the only one who wants it i think *you* should look into it xd

06
It shouldn’t change it too much

06
I mean the code not the chest

06
Chest bad

06
its literally just adding `or barrel` to the end of a couple if statements

06
```if block at {mb::%arg 1%} is not chest:```

06
```if block at {mb::%arg 1%} is not chest or barrel:```

Nice.

01
wait @Toaster what version is the server in

02
1.14.4

02
ok thanks

02
im gonna join probably

02
hey @Toaster can you whitelist me to the server

02
mc username?

02
Zildin

02
**Something I'm thinking of doing with the server:**
Getting worldguard (region selectiona and settings) and a permission plugin;
Setting up 3 ranks



Regions that new players cant edit would be towns and any individual houses people want admins to claim
this would take a little while to set up because permission plugins are kinda pee pee poo poo garbage but would probably do it when i get back from AK trip

Any opposition/ideas?

02
thatd be great

02
also if you dont have it 1 player sleep

02
its sometimes painful getting everyone to sleep at once

02
Sensible idea, toaster.

I should join the server sometime

02
you can join now. i just did and am super late to the party

02
I dont want to take away from the community kinda feeling of the server and make it all moderated and closely watched but having a way to keep people we arent sure about from griefing yet still let them join

02
yeah that works

02
so people can still do whatever except fucking with community areas or private property

02
yeah

02
Sensible.

02
Very sensible.

02
you should add a moderator rank

02
that people can apply on a google form for

02
nah ill just have friends and people whove played a long time as admins

02
ah

02
will i be able to finish my house with the new rank?

02
yeah probably

02
Pinned a message.

02
we should have a trade system if not a money system

02
like /trade and we can trade items with eachother

02
we have one

02
whats the command

02
not trading but we have money conversion

02
oh

02
or we could just do it manually..

02
yeah but then we have to be in the same area

02
mailboxes exist

02
oh

02
yeah

02
forgot about that

02
are you leaving @Toaster

02
yeah

02
gtg to alaska

02
Oof

02
Enjoy

03
Yo should I joineth the server?

04
yeah

04
but someone needs to add you

04

05

05

05

05

05

06
@Alterae

06
you're good

06
I am back @Spymasterjimmy

07
Was consuming dinner.

07
@GoldenPot8o what's ip again

07
nvm found it

07
@Zildin I'm on sever.  Where is your place?

08
if i played a different game would people watch?

08
i got bad internet so nah

08
plus i think u gotta sort out ur mic and turn on low latency n stuff ngl

08
you can listen to the mic output while not streaming

08
or while streaming but idk why youd want thag

09
hey @Toaster could you whitelist my second minecraft account?

09
the ign is **reground**

09
uh why the fuck

09
uhh why not

09
because why the fuck u need two accounts on one server

09
i use both accounts on other servers tho

09
seems shady as hell to me considering we literally know you have hacked clients

09
i deleted them

09
also its for when i go on vacation because i only have login for the other account on my laptop

09
im not whitelisting any1 (and nate and jok shouldnt either) until i get back from my trip

09
oh

09
okay i guess

09
how long is your trip?

09
til like next sunday

09
@casualwhitenut  just add your account to your laptop ...

09
^^^^

09
i dont remember login

09
r e s e t p a s s w o r d

09
login includes email

09
i dont remember which one i used

09
i have so many

09
thats on u for being small brain

09
i am small brain sometimes but why cant i get whitelist on my other account too?

09
if you think im going to get banned on one and use the other, just add a plugin that IP bans

09
cuz




09
also u can ip ban just from bukkit

09
dont need a plugin for that

09
k so why dont do that if i hack again?

09
i will

09
k

09
can nate or other admin whitelist me orr when you get bacc from trip

09
no well just do it when i get back

09
k

09
yo @Alterae you still alive

09
@Alterae my wifi is no longer dead if you still need some sweet berries

09

https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/539106814697013250/604908240446423050/image0.jpg

11
o

11
i think top 3 is most important

11
yeah

11
bottom one is more just slightly helpful but not needed

11
me and tiso friends and the damage thing sucks

11
yeah

11
You talk too much, @Zildin. You just advanced to level 12.

11
yeah i cant do anything while on travel but once i get back

11
stuffs gonna happen

11
yay

11
you should stream the changes

11
also will probably split the streamnotifs role into 3 roles, one for me, one for nate, one for jonathan

11
ooh that’d be neat

11
teah i prolly will

11
any other suggestions for the discord/mc server

11
im down to do stuff so

11
cool

11
what pluggins do you use?

11
skript, plugman, soon to use worldguard and probably permissionsex but well see about permission stuff

11
think thats all but not sure

11
u can do /plugins on the server

11
cool

11
o ok

11
i think silk spawners would make everyone happy

11
o yeah

11
get like 16 blaze spawners

11
oh yea that is one farm

11
yeah if there’s a plug

11
silk

11
touch

11
spawners

11
oh yeah right

11
wait that works?

11
should i make my MC server trello board public and have a suggestion part

11
as a plugin

11
what toaster

11
idk

11
i’m not big brain littler works

11
*words

11
basically let u suggest stuff on what i use to keep track of what i need to do

11
thatd be cool

11
yeah but make it as a separate list

11
so the main one won’t flood

11
yo i need to go good night you guys

11
night

11
yeah right now i have todo and done but would probably add suggestions and denied suggestions

11
gnite

11
ok but how does silk touching a spawner work?

11
its a plugin

11
ah

11
does the mob stay in?

11
lets u mine spawners with silk touch to get them as an itsm

11
yeah

11
nice

11
time to try and make some farms with this

11
like blaze

11
well its not on there yet

11
cuz that’d be nice

11
yeah lol

11
but it’d be cool

11
can they spawn if in water

11
idk

07
@JONKKKK are you able to help me with my items?

08
yeah i lost everything

08
because the stupied server lagging

08

08
and fell in the void

09
@JONKKKK I have a list if your able to help me soon

09
Ill dm it to you

09
You talk too much, @Soundwave. You just advanced to level 3.

09
And i’m hoping on now

10
@JONKKKK sill spawners is a plugin that lets you mine soawners with silk touch and get the itsm

10
oh ok

10
that seems a little op but eh

10
yeah idk

10
ppl want it tho so

10
It’d be cool if you could change what the spawner is by putting an item from the mob you want to change it too into the spawner

Hey everybody i will be giving away all of these items dm and join the game and tell me what you need and i will try and gift it to you, P.S. hey toast i know your on vacation so don't worry i will save you some stuff

11
Elytra and a few shulker boxes is all I want

11
You can mail them to me

11
aight

11
so elytra, set of 8 shulker?

11
Yeah 8 boxes not shells

11
well that would be 16 shells i think 4 boxes is fair cause everyone will want some and i dont plan on going to the end unless i want to build a base

11
Ok

11
whats your mb

11
@GoldenPot8o

11
Oh I’ll have to check

11
o ok

11
i think well probably stop giving people stuff when they die, regardless of if it was caused by lag or not, just because at how much stuff we have you should just have stuff saved up anyways so if you dont then thats on you

12

i play on other servers with other people

09
yeaa

09
jimbo?

11
hey gamers ik its like 11:30 where u are (nat and jok and whoever else is on MST) but ive thought about this idea for a bot and just wanted to get opinions

11
hit me

11
if/when we reset the world (not to imply well do it soon, were all still enjoying this one) i think itd be cool to do a smp on amplified, could be called ASMP or somethin idk

11
just feel like survival on an amplified world would be really fun

11
again not to say that im gonna reset the world soon bcuz im not gonna

11
lemme just uum

11
ASM~~P~~ R

11
b r u h

11
but yeah doing amplified smp would be rly fun

11
thats not a bot

11
i think so, at least

11
also other thing

11
in announcements i put the link to my list of stuff to do for the server

11
feel free to suggest stuff on that

11
and/or just look at what im planning and talk about it

11
ASMP could stand for a couple things lol

amplified survival multiplayer
anarchy survival multiplayer
absolutely shitty multiplayer

11
a stranger minecraft playthrough

11
also i made a suggestion

11
ass shit my piss

11
that is all i have to say

11
well i dont know what to say

11
thank you for the anti suggestion

11
im ***suggesting*** that the rest of you pick a side

11
and the two sides areee....?

11
Potato Inc. and well

11
the other ones

11
im already allied with you in our bonemeal producing scheme

11
everybody has a grey area

11
you see

11
everything you do blurs some line

11
dunno which ones

11
but it do

11
also you should hold off on doing/starting anything drastic till i get back ples

11
im allied with major parts of the loosely formed government on this planet, i have the working class on my side and am undertaking plans to cement the need for me in the server's economy and the server's populous

11
i feel like thats impossible but ok

11
im probably being overdramatic again ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

11
unless you are going to make it so literally everyone doesnt have access to some literally *essential* item/group of items and that you have a monopoly on said group/item then idk how youre gonna make that work

11
but again ples hold off on any monopolies or drastic schemes and such until i get back and can document it

11
you got it boss

11
1 minute until august

11
2, really

12
WHO THE FUCK BROKE THE ENDERFARM

12
who ever it was did a shitty job of covering their tracks

12
How so?

12
NANI

12
My beautiful farm

12
Da faque happened to it?

12
@GoldenPot8o

12
Jimbo is gone

12
What you mean

12
How he gone?

12
The endermite is gone

12
Oohhhhhh

12
Not in the Minecraft

12
I am so sorry

12
*cart

12
Oh

12
I did that on accident

12
Nice

12
I thought you meant like destroyed it

12
No

12
Do I need to come and fix it?

12
No I’m off now

12
Oh ok cool

12
I’m making villager farm tomorrow

12
And carrot/potat farm

07
bruh i was askin for not that much automation until i get back (at l e a s t) and you come in here and just make like 5 farms in a week calm down

07
i just read the above messages and i think that amplified would be fun

07
but yeah everyone here likes automation which is why we're making farms

07
that rule just kinda ruins the fun for us

07
yes but i also will want to make farms and if i come back to 5+ new farms im gonna have nothing to do

07
ig

08
guaranteed: im gonna get back and soley because i missed out on so much will have kinda lost interest in the mc stuff and even though ill still play on it ill start streaming other stuff more because playing minecraft every day for 5 hours wont be fun anymore

08
not saying that doing other stuff is a bad thing

08
but i g u a r a n t e e i will have lost interest in the mc world at LEAST a bit

08
just build:
town
shop
company
house

08
thats what you told me at least

08
yo i have verything accept achievements and a trident i can do practically anything for u and u just build and enjoy yourself

08
yeah i probably will but its not fun to do stuff like that unless there are people to do it with or have community fun or whatever with and i cant build a company or shop because i have nothing to sell because everythings already automated

08
talk about getting bored i play 12 hrs on it most days so i have everything i could want (accept a trident)

08
nah theres still lots of stuff that we dont have

08
we dont have a reliable source of gunpowder

08
^

08
or gold

08
or iron

08
and we could actually build a guardian farm

08
could but enderman are better

08
nah guardian farms are faster

08
it goes to lvl 30 in 30 seconds not 2 mintes

08
i know this because i did it

08
all im sayin is i will inevitably have lost interest

08
wellllllllll

08
we will have to see

08
sounds like nates being a gamer bcuz hes planning community stuff but

08
idk mannnn

08
if you stop thinking of it as inevitable maybe you wont but if you keep on saying that you'll lose interest* it *will* be inevitable

08
that is defo false but ok

08
i agree with jonk

08
its not like i *want* to lose interest but just because i missed out on a week of stuff AND you guys did a ton if stuff in that week its pretty much whatll happen

08
hey toast i will have you armour just like mine for the dragon when you get back

08
You talk too much, @Soundwave. You just advanced to level 6.

08
m a y b e if i just didnt interact with you guys for a week and just worked on my own stuff in solitude until i kinda caught up (especially since just kinda breaking off and doing your own chill thing is fun anyways) but thatd be boring for other obvious reasons

08
im pretty sure giving him stuff will be counterproductive

08
??????????

08
yeah ^^^^^^ just throwing OP gear at me will def make me more bored

08
ok nevermind then

08
i mean we *could* get you elytra because you'll need them for the giant end raid

08
^

08
(assuming you'll wanna go to the end cities)

08
i upvote this post

08
not rly lol

08
exploring the end doesnt seem that interesting to me but

08
well see

08
well you'll probably want shulkers n stuff

08
meh

08
your the one whos always like “bruh sound effect bro we gotta have elytra and shulker boxes”

08
idrc about that stuff

08
lol

08
i mean its still useful and im p sure we're all gonna do it together so you might as well be there

08
i did in fact say well see at the end of that

08
oh ok lol

08
as of right now no thanks but i am not home right now and we are not doing it right now

08
but yeah im probably gonna get elytra for you because imma end bust later anyway

08
hey jonk i couldnt find the seed in chat do you think sometime you could dm it to me?

08


08
thanks

08
Pinned a message.

08
am about to go fishing

08

09
i just got a terrible but also would probably be very funny idea

09
?

09
all im gonna say is
you can set the maximum render distance people can use in server config

09
wow

09
That sounds terrifiying

09
imagine trying to do ender dragon at 2 render distance

05

05
nein yu

05

05

05
oh cool

05
sophomore

05
im going into 9th freshma

05
xddd

05
man*

05
Have fun with that.

05
oh noes

05
why

05
well i do this 8/9 school and then i go to a 10/11/12 one

05
ppl usually make fun of freshman lol

05
but at least where we go its not too bad

05
oh rly

05
yes rly

05
we do 1

05
Yeah.

05
oh i did 1

05
am doing

05
Putting sixth and eighth graders in the same building?

05
What a horrible idea.

05
thats an oof

05
lol

05
well im past that now

05
is it like 9th are seperated from the rest of the high school?

05
yea

05
so its a school with 8th and 9th or you go to the middle school thats 6

05
ah ok we have something kinda like that but its really just the school trying to get more money xd

05
ohhh

05
xD

05
Ye grade 9 is kinda sorta a separate school/

05
im did ms then 9

05
But it's in the same campus and buildings as the high school.

05
And it's basically just a cash

05
our high school has a thing to “ease in” middle schoolers which is just a seperate building for core classes

05
same campus just a football field away

05
but yeah^^^^^ just cash grab lol

05
I mean I'm all for the distric getting cash.

Hey toaster, whats that thing you use to use your PC remotely?

01
Chrome remote access I think.

01
mk

01
You talk too much, @casualwhitenut. You just advanced to level 7.

01
what about parsec is that good?

01
Idk what that is.

01
no thats only for games

01
and you have to have ppl on both ends

01
i think

01
oh

01
so google remote desktop?

01
ye chrome remote desktop

01
okay lemme try it out, whats the internet requirements?

01
idk

01
what are you trying to do?

01
game with lowest latency about 2800 miles away from my rig

01
uhh

01
yeah ur gonna need good internet

01
is there someone on the other end?

01
like how many megabits p/s?

01
i have no idea

01
but you need someone on the other end to set it up

01
i have my laptop with me rn and im just tryna get it setup for when i go on vacation

01
oh ok

01
are you gonna be using hotel wifi?

01
no, gonna be at my grandmas house

01
do you know how good the internet is there?

01
i think she has like comcast wifi

01
got new mending villager and it cost 20 emeralds

01
idk she isnt super techy

01
its probably like 50mbps or something

01
what games will you be playing? like chill ones or fast paced ones

01
uhh probably minecraft or csgo casual idk

01
but yeah idk how to set it up i just know that toaster uses it

01
and just surfing the web because my laptop is slow with that

01
okay

01
just google it lol

01
are you 100% sure tis google  remote desktop tho and not something else?

01
its chrome remote desktop not google remote desktop

01
same thing

01
chrome is google

01
not nessecarily but yeah its called chrome remote desktop so google that

01
you wont get much if you google google remote desktop

01
okay i got chrome remote desktop working

01
and its alright, the quality is low

01
yeah its not rlly designed for gaming

01
and *maybe* parsec will work idk much about it

01
okay

01
ill give it a look

01
hmm what about nvidia moonlight??

01
lemme check that one out too :p

01
idk

01
Update, Parsec is a lot more crisp than chrome remote desktop

01
can you use it without someone on the other end?

01
ya

01
ui setup my gaming rig

01
oh huh

01
and downloaded it on my laptop and clicked play

01
ofc you hvae to login and stuff but it works

01
im gonna try moonlight now and see which one i like better

03
No parsec can be enabled to do remote access

03
Jonk is wonky

03
yeah

03
Parsec works best for me

05

06
ok so that episode was about a thumb war and one character plays video games a lot and was beating everyone in a button mashing game and they ended up winning the competition

06
but it turns out he just bribed everyone

06
like they play it up to make it seem like hes really good at thumb wars

06
idk why but it was really funny for no reason

06
more out of context screenshots
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/539106814697013250/607374793683107860/unknown.png

06

https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/539106814697013250/607375505527668766/unknown.png

06
thats so gay

06
no u

06
no that is a male looking like some fury cat shit

06
hell no u

07
no u

07
thats gay is right

07
(yeah it was like a .5 second clip for a joke lol)

07
but imagine a show where a character actually looks like that lmao

07
ew

07
i wouldnt watch

07
id rather die

07
*insert that one cats movie thats coming out that looks terrible here*

07
theres a cat movie?

07
?

07
https://www.google.com/search?q=cats+movie&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjW7NSEhujjAhVVVc0KHQdfBp8Q_AUIEygD&biw=1910&bih=1009#imgrc=ulon

07
Don't look.

07
Don't fucking look.

07
what is it

07
its not nsfw or anything just really really REALLY bad

07
Y'know that's one thing furries are good for.

If any of them had worked on the movie it wouldn't be so terrible.

07
its a cgi movie where people are cats or something

07
wtf

07
thats gay

07
No.

07
It's just awful.

07
it has *trancended*

07
its trans gender

07
its wrong

07
Nah.

07
yes

07
Wrong, ye.

07
its fucking gay

07
ew

07
But it's nothing to do with lgbt folk and suggesting otherwise is honestly annoying.

07
it looks like a terrible cgi movie

07
yeah what will said ^

07
It is.

07
THank you jonk.

07
has it come out yet lmao

07
if so i wanna kill everyone who sees it

07
no i dont think so

07
good

07
its super bad

07
its like sonic

07
but worse

07
Yeah.

07
x2

07
Again at least according to the internet this could have been averted if we'd just had a furry or two doing character design.

07
yeah but then it would be rated R

07
/s

07
furies are gay

07
if you like furies you can leave

07
I never said I do.

07
And also plenty of furries are straight.

07
n oi

07
no u

07
So your analysis is factually incorrect.

07
theyre all gay

07
and stupid

07
i feel like furies would be the plural of fury

07
Yeah it is.

07
Oh fuck.

07
because you spelled it wrong lol

07
Yeah it is actually.

07
lmao

07
Fury
Furry

07
One is a creature from Greek myth, and the other's a furry.

07
and furies are the stupid things

07
so what are furries?

07
some random greek myth

07
so they dont actually exist

07
Honestly if they ain't fucking animals or something I don't think I care.

If you get off to anthropomorphic animals then that's your buisiness.

07
Actually know it's furies that are mythological.

07
no its furries

07
not furies

07
furries is the myth

07
furies is stupid gay shit

07
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erinyes
Wikipedia says no.

07
Wikipedia is gay aswell

07
stop using facts

07
please

07
Ah yes that totally makes sense I absolutely surrender to your obviously superior debate skills.

07
/s

07
yeah

07
thanks

07
stop

07
stop linking reddit outside of reddit

07
you got me dude

07
i deleted my message so this no longer makes sense

09
since matt kept calling everything gay as an insult hes kinda gay ngl

09
wait

09
are you coming out /s

09
you're calling calling things gay gay

09
wait i confused myself

09
its almost recursive but in a lame way

09
also matt i must also say that
1) its fuccin furry not fury
2) furries arent usually that bad, its just a case of the bad minority being loud, and to quote will (roughly) who cares if u get off to anthro animals

09
your whole convo with each other hurt my soul

09
so before you were saying that by saying that by saying that by saying that by saying that by saying that by saying that by

09
boom i made it recursive

So yesterday on Reddit I got 5k upvotes, four silver awards, one gold award, and a fucking PLATINUM.

All basically because I didn't know my ABCs just right.

06

https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/539106814697013250/607556233897181185/image0.jpg

06
reddit flexing is for peepoo brains

06
Somebody did, though.

06
I never asked for awards.

I never asked for any of it

06
yeah but whether you ask for it or not going into a discord chat and saying “lul i got 25bil upvotes and 90 platinum by AcCiDeNt” is still reddit flexing and thats peepeepoopoo

07
I mean kinda but mostly you're just being salty and you should stop.

07
You talk too much, @Alterae. You just advanced to level 10.

07
Thanks, Stinky.

07
yea im sorta salty just because reddit flexing is peepeepoopoo and you just did it

07
you just did something that I am annoyed by, is that not a reason to be annoyed

07
I mean it is and your annoyance is valid but at the same time I'm a little miffed because I feel like you're kinda shitting on my good day because you're in a bad mood.

07
am abt to get on plane btw i will hafta go

07

07
Ah.

07
Oof.

Well, welcome to almost home.

But yeah I get why you're grumpy if you had to wake up at four.

dear lord

10
nani?

10
bear lorb

10
It is currently August 4st

10
Yup.

11
one flight down

11
one to go

11
Nice.

11
and then a two hour drive

11
Did you get the window seat?

11
yeah

11
Window seats are best.

11
What airline?

11
idk bout the next flight tho

11
alaska

11
Also can I just say there is NOTHING BETTER than the sight of the inside of Albuquerque airport after all the other airports.  THEY ARE SO GREY and then abq has nice warm brown and turquoise and it's so fucking refreshing after a long day of flying.

11
hehe

11
i like the largeness of other airports better kinda idk how to explain it

11
Yeah I get that.

11
They've got a certain *energy*.

11
But they're also so fucking GREY.

11
big airports like (surprisingly) the one in anchorage AK are really nice

11
And that gets old.

11
yeah sure

11
I've been to BWI.

11
imo it kinda has a sweet spot

11
And buffalo's airport.

11
They're both kinda similar.

11
dallas is too big where its just annoying to get to

11
to go anywhere*

11
And then ABQ is like actually aesthetically different

11
never been to Dallas.

11
the one in AK is really moderb and nice and has some cool art

11
Oh nice.

11
they have an entire hallway where the cieling is meant to simulate the aurora

11
Niiiice.

11
time to sleep for another 3 hours and then wake up for a small amount of time and then sleep for 2 more and then be home

11
Nice.

11
I never sleep on planes.

11
On flight from BWI to ABQ back in march or whatever I was sitting with these two little kids who were also from LA.

11
i get tired on literally any form of transport that i am not driving so

11
i usually end up sleeping

11
Oof.

11
I can't sleep during the day or while sitting up.

11
damb

11
Also these little kids were actually really well behaved.

11
The younger one needed to be reminded about seatbelts a few times.

11
But they were chill.

11
hehe

11
ok i gtg

11
not on the other plane yet but gotta get there from this one lul

11
Cya.

12
2 chests + a bit of stuff lul

12
Any good stuff?

12
fuck i dont know what any enchantments are because its all in french

12
XD

12
oh have a fun fact that i told jonathan last night in DMs

12
bane of arthropods in french is "fléau des arthropodes" which translates to plague of arthropods and that is way cooler than bane

12
AHAHA

12
PUNCH IS JUST HIT

12
its so dark

12
he has shaders

12
I know

12
fun fact: the enderman farm is probably whats making the server so laggy cuz it wasnt laggy before it existed and its about 100+ entities all in one place

12
true

12
i mean theres no enderman when nobodys in the end

12
cuz i had a cow farm with like 200 cows and that killed my server which had 16gb of ram dedicated to it

12
this server has 2gb

12
well they get unloaded when nobodys around

12
yeah thats true but

12
whenever the servers being laggy check if anyone in the end

12
also jonathan i must point out that while im ok with automation (for the most part) now

12
this is a very good reason to not allow it

12
ye

12
(not saying we should)

12
if yall are gonna build farms like this then you either gotta start donating a collective 50 bucks every month or not complain about lag

08
no

08
im not gonna get any plugins ive browsed like literally all of the 1.14 plugins and i have only gotten the ones i want

08
the only things you can suggest that we will get are ones we already have

08
they are datapacks

08
yeah but they just make things easier

08
then extra no

08
they add no depth

08
because im too lazy to install datapacks

08
and also ^^^^^^^^

08
its just

08
easy mode

08
and thats a fact

08
but yeah just make a drowned farm

08
they are complicated

08
idk how or how to find one that works

08
thats how its s u p p o s e d t o b e

08
wow look at that i just searched it and then went to the videos tab
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/539106814697013250/609388695962910720/unknown.png

08
how will i ever know how to make a drowned farm with all of these helpful tutorial videos telling me how oh no

08
i will never survive

08
^

08
correct

08
but come on this one is atleast fun
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/539106814697013250/609388822647799847/unknown.png

08
no

08
fucken hell your picky

08
i dont wanna install datapacks

08
datapacks are annoying to install

08
no they arent

08
yeah they are

08
its plugins except you have to restart the entire server whenever you install one

08
press download, put in folder, restart  server

08
3 easy steps

08
simple

08
yes

08
but thats 1 more step than with plugins

08
and also all the datapacks youre suggesting are not that good

08
for reasons that jonathan has stated

08
yeah pvp playerheads will just encourage pvp

AWWWW man

01
connor you dont even play on the server wtf are you doing

01
i used to

01
and i should probably play on it more

01
also makysym whats your discord username cuz we probably know you by that if you play on the server

01
mc you mean?

01
if you havent played on the server then GET OUTTA MY POLL

01
yeah i meant mc

01
@Maksym11713

01
Lol i dont play on the server

01
i thought so lul

01
But y'all should invite me

01
I WANN A JOIIIIIIIIN

01
wdym bruh its literally pinned in announcements

01
no whitelist

01
O ok

01
but if you havent played on it then why dont u want it to reset? genuinly curious as to that one

01
I WANN see

01
*wann

01
cuz i must say that while i am all in favor of democracy I am the one paying monthly to host the server and I very much want to reset it to amplified

01
so unless we get an overwhelming amount of "no"s AND ppl actually start playing on it again then itll prolly reset

01
cuz if you just say "no dont reset it" and then dont play on it your opinion doesnt count

01
its not like anything will change for you bc you usually build underground lol

01
but in amplified there so much MORE underground

01
and you can do way cooler stuff with it

01
Yea, it'd probably lag my really computer

04
Are more coming?

04
theyare

04
they're all new accounts

04
Damn why

04
tbh pretty sure we just need to ban literally everyone in the server list who's thing says they're a new user since that seems to be literally all of them

04
a 4chan user probably

04
wow they didn't even post close together that time

04
i dont think theres a way to do that

04
Omfg

04
random gifs and videos

How

04
no scam

04
thats the guy

04
discord tokens lmao

04
with the army of bots

04
lots of them

04
The only thing that made my day was dropping my phone down the stairs for fun

04
You talk too much, @Serendipity. You just advanced to level 11.

04
r u still on my stream? lul

04
let me guess. was it khm. vibrating too much?

04
Nah I just did it for fun

04
The video after was funny

04
It made me laugh

04
btw. BlackSpigot is not scam lol

04
🗿

04
it's a real thing lol

04
u still watching the stream or do we have to talk to u here instead of live

04
Why'd you do that tho

04
watching the stream haha

04
You talk too much, @SauronBSMC. You just advanced to level 1.

04
yeah. i hate cloudflare

04
Wacc

04
it's easy to get backend of discord

04
i sent the requests too lol

04
and the images, gifs. videos

04
https://gyazo.com/42c73b77fa0c516ed17fc14e11a0e888

04
I know that guy.. it's me lol

04
FactionsUUID is a paid plugin

04
https://gyazo.com/c37773bc3aece4f9a57663647bea64fe

04
https://blackspigot.com/downloads/factionsuuid.11956/ <<

04
We buy it, then remove the IDs that are automatically injected by SpigotMC as anti

04
Actually. Everything is owned by Mojang, everything made in minecraft is owned by Mojang (and Mojang is owned by Microsoft)

04
So if they sell plugins they are selling a part of their code, which is pretty much copyright infringement too

04
ok so what the hell happened

04
nothing

04
we are talking

04
i come back to here and see the aftermath of a raid/spammed/bullshit

04
he started spamming toaster on stream, toaster befriended them

04
watch the stream if you wannna hear both sides of the convo

04
who?

04
I did spam him lmao

04
ok but what’s with the shit ton of people

04
yeah he was spam advertising

04
i know. clever

04
not really

04
yeah

04
ur just making ur website seem more sketchy if anything lol

04
imho fuck spam advertising

04
but jonk what was the whole people spam joining

04
that was sauron

04
https://account.mojang.com/documents/commercial_guidelines

04
he was controlling them

04
why the fuck

04
¯\_(ツ)_/¯

04
~~then why is he still here~~

04
so uh what's happening

04
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQdxHi4_Pvc
I found this video.

04
all i can understand is the guy running the bots also runs a piracy service

05
yeah pretty much

05
yeah thats p much it

05
why is he still here then

05
i don't run it lol

05
yeah why is he here

05
this all seems sketchy af

05
This is very sketch.

05
Just a Head of Staff, not the hoster

05
but like...

05
why?

05
seriously why is this guy still here toast

05
all he's done is spam the discord and then basically advertise an illegal service

05
Yeah.

05
yeah idk toaster doesnt think he did anything bad

05
bruh

05
And if I want piracy I do it myself thankyouverymuch.

05
bruh

05
bruh

05
oh nvm nothing malicious*

05
i mean i don’t remember this many people on the server

05
are you sure you got all of them

05
there’s 2 that are identical except the number

05
give me your credit card number

05
a lot of ppl are from strems and stuff

05
nah there's a few strays

05
if you click on the profile and it says they're new to discord

05
there are two named aka DJ

05
80% chance that's one of the bots

05
no they were real accounts hijacked

05
hmm

05
Oof.

05
anyways even if he did nothing malicious he's still basically advertising a piracy site and he also got a bunch of bots to spam??

05
essentially

05
Yeah.

05
And spam *is* malicious when it's this spammy.

05
it’s not fun

05
Well. I don't see any spam advertising.. do you?

05
You talk too much, @SauronBSMC. You just advanced to level 2.

05
people spam is still spam

05
I don't even know the ip lol

05
to what?

05
the mc server

05
probably for the best

05
Definitely.

05
yes

05
duh

05
he uhh

05
he got in

05
to the server?

05
yeah

05
oof

05
Ah shite.

05
that’s not good

05
Well I'm never active there anywyas lol.

05
i mean same but still

05
But I have a bad feeling 'bout this...

05
if i go back i want to be able to stay alive

05
we're watching him lol

05
and not have my house destroyed

05
oof

05
idea: instead of just watching the guy who both advertised a piracy site he's head admin on or something and spammed the discord, ban him?

05
Maybe.

05
I agree

05
toaster repinned the ip so thats probably how

05
jonk is it the same server?

05
that was after he got it

05
oh ok

05
oof

05
Ban me?

05
wait toaster is it the same server?

05
wdym

05
poll

05
What’s happening?

05
did you reamke the server or no?

05
what

05
the mc server

05
k hes banned

05
from mc

05
is it now an amplified world or the same world

05
same world

05
oh ok

05
nice

05
tl;dr: sauron gets in server, gets bots to spam server with random stuff, sauron then advertises a piracy site he's head on, and then got into the mc server ~~and isn't banned on the discord~~

05
yeah. at least give it a reason

05
give me your credit card number

05
dooo iiiit

05
No give me it

05
give me your credit card number

05
The Ban Hammer has spoken! is not a "valid" reason

05
i mean it is

05
ok

05
just to clear things up

05
TO MANT THINGS ARE HAPPENING

05
Many

05
lol yeah

05
were yall talking about banning him from the discord or the MC server because it very much felt like yall were talking about the discord

05
theres not much bad he can do on the MC server

05
is the permissions thing set up?

05
yes

05
it has been for like 2 weeks

05
are you on the server

05
yes

05
ok

05
imma try and join server

05
I mean, we don't have to ban him,  as long as he doesn't do what he did again rite

05
i mean maybe?

05
we said the same thing about soundeave

05
Wave

05
what did soundwave do?

05
He hacked

05
oh oof

05
Oof

05
And then got banned

05
what hack?

05
You see if this were my server Sauron would be kicked half an hour ago, and/or banned ten minutes ago.

05
But it's not my server.

05
he was using impact

05
??

05
hacked client

05
ok

05
he was using baritone (pathfinding) and xray hacking

05
aswell as flying n such

05
oof

05
why the fuck

05
This is all just  w a c c

05
Why would you even hack in *survival*.

05
Like if it's competitive or something I'd see why you could be motivated.

05
But not in normal survival.

05
THat's beyond lazy.

05
its cuz its tedious

05
Eh

05
hey connor watch the stream if you wanna hear what we're saying

05
```./rg flag __global__ build deny```

05
?

05
nvm

05
uhh

05
i'm banned anyways. so yeah

05
./?

05
What is this?  Linux?

05
``?``

05
dafuq are you talking about

05
yo toast, unban me

05
`./file` would be a lame way to access a `file` if it's in the folder you're looking at.
`.` is the current folder you're in.

05
thats not a linux thing

05
thats just a code thing

05
and thats not what he was doing

05
i mean it's common in unix

05
also toaster is there a way to make it so nobody can interact in your houses without permissions

05
back

05
connor watch the stream at https://www.twitch.tv/toasterr

05
so you can hear what were saying

05
so no unban?

05
becaus if no unban i'll close minecraft now lol

05
alright

05
nvm

Ooof

06
@HollowRisk why

06
you need to dont exist

06
i have ascended

06
you have lost braincells not ascended

06
all of it was gambling lol

06
Of course

06
gamba time

06
yeah you like actually have an unhealthy addiction

06
yeaa

06
most of the time i spend it cosmetics, this time i spent it on a chance to get an $102 cosmetic

06
And did you get the cosmetic

06
no lol

06
lovely

07
you stupid bitch

07
No u

07
well you see

07
you could have like

07
gotten a new computer with that money

07
when you spend 1k, it’s gambling

07
when i do, i get a half decent computer

07
It’s not gambling if most of the time I get what I want by buying it off the steam market, i have only bought around 100

07
but like

07
*why*

07
it’s fucking cosmetics

07
logan #may

07
Hec

07
I already have pc worth 1k

07
it’s like when people buy a couple thousand v

07
So I don’t need that

07
it’s cosmetics

07
it does nothing

07
Very cool looking  : )

07
then save it for something that isn’t bad

07
and no

07
the experience is the exact same

07
there is no reason to

07
Cosmetics help the game make money and my friends happy because they get gifts

07
It’s a win win

07
My laptop has dead battery.

07
Am sad

07
so your friends get happy when you waste money

07
great friends

07
It’s not a waste if I enjoy it

07
it is if it’s a look

07
I could say you are wasting your money by going to school

07
that’s like if you had to pay to use texture packs

07
what

07
and you really can’t

07
school is free

07
Nothing wrong with spending money on cosmetics.

07
not all the classes

07
School isn’t free jonk

07
Is a personal choice

07
You have to pay fees bruh

07
and how is school a waste

07
oh well yeah

07
Support the devs

07
I never said it was a waste

07
but its 150 dollars, not A THOUSAND

07
I said I could say it was a waste

07
idk man college expensive

07
yeah lol

07
just sayin he coulda been talkong abt that

07
And would you rather the game charge for non

07
not advocating for quinn cuz he dum as hell but you could definitely point out that school is a waste of money

07
i’m not super against purchasing cosmetics i just don’t understand the reasoning

07
i mean if you didnt go to school you like

07
Because I like cosmetics and they are very cool!

07
couldnt get a job

07
thats cuz we live in a society

07
college is another story but

07
usa kinsa stupid as fuc

07
Having one cosmetic is alright

07
but games should have methods of acquiring cosmetics without spending a shit ton of money

07
You talk too much, @Zildin. You just advanced to level 13.

07
Thats true

07
You can acquire cosmetics in DotA with spending a cent

07
Yes

07
that’s good

07
What Connor said

07
I choose to spend the money

07
Otherwise you end up reaching the limit on your card

07
so you’ve chosen to spend 1k on cosmetics

07
Yes

07
See I just use whatever cosmetics I get from gameplay.

07
dumb man ^

07
oh wait

07
oof

07
How the fuck do you have a spare grand for that?

07
xd

07
oh boy bad service

07
I work

07
Yup

07
Bus is fun

07
And have no need for anything else

07
My messages take long to send

07
also do ur parents know that you spent 1000 bucks on a video game

07
Yes

07
It’s my money that I worked for

07
oh really?

07
They don’t approve

07
lol ur loss then

07
Yeah if I was spending my parents money I would feel bad

07
But it’s my money

07
So whatever

07
I mean yeah it's a personal choice

07
You still have parents covering your living costs.

07
Enjoy while it lasts

07

03
Bruh I’ve been doing that

03

03
i was talking to nate not u quinn

03

03

03
what

03
Fuck I don’t know dude

03
well gg come over if u want but we gonna bike

03
I do want to go biking but the main thing stopping me is my parents being retarded

03
o rly

03
wqs ur dad like b r u h

03
if u can come over then why cant u bike

03
u dont even have to bring a bike

03
Just stop trying to understand, it’s a schedule issue

03
ok lul

03
I’m gonna come over, I WOULD HEAVILY PREFER IF SATCHEL CAME TOO, and I would also like it if WE DIDNT BIKE, but it’s really not helpful when I’m making a decision if one crucial person isn’t giving straight answers

03
is that person me

03
because we biking 100%

03
or is that person sathel

03
stchel

03
satchel

03
It’s you

03
what answer do u want

03
we biking

03
well wait if ur gonna come but

03
Could have figured this out way faster if a) you shut the fuck up when I’m typing, and b) if you answered immediately when I asked questions

03
wot

03
wtv

03
we biking

03
we goin

03
Where would we go if I did go?

03
Trails, that is

03
you know the trail at the horse stables

03
goes out to the end of the mesa

03
No

03
oh

03
its really easy we go on a dirt road beside the actual trail and its like flat the entire time

03
Iv never been mountain biking

03
Ok

03
we can obv go slow if someone gets really tired or something but its a pretty easy trail

03
going back is the hard part because its all *very slightly* uphill

03
but that means that going out its all really ez

03
Ya, I'll go

03
Give me a few minutes

03
mk

03

03
yo toaster do you have a vr

03
no

03
i dont

03
oh ok

03
oof

03
id only get it if like 3 other ppl in out friend group also gt it

03
also jonk which was the one you have

03
oculus rift

03
i’m intending to acquire one

03
yeah you wouldnt like it tho

03
wires?

03
you would probably want the quest

03
wires + cameras

03
how bad are the wires

03
pretty bad

03
well

03
oh oof

03
not really

03
get steams one

03
?

03
They have one?

03
those ones have cameras and he doesnt want them

03
yeah the valve ones

03
yeah i don’t have room

03
wdym what

03
rift s needs no sensors

03
i don’t have a lot of room

03
steam vr has camera

03
?

03
ah ok

03
yeah

03
like unless it’s this tiny thing then i probably can’t

03
so oculus quest?

03
quest doesnt have cams rite

03
yh

03
yeah

03
but it 500 bucc

03
and no comp needed

03
oh

03
that’s not too much

03
i think

03
yeah quest only has oculus games

03
i would reccomend the rift s

03
ok

03
can it do steam and stuff

03
yea

03
also how the fuck do i find vr games, especially for a wireless one

03
on the vr store

03
its an app on the system itself i think?

03
idk

03
steam

03
no on the quest

03
oh nice

03
oh quest cant do steam games

03
oh oof

03
for fucking 500 bucks?

03
i mean

03
you can take it anywhere

03
also

03
beat saber and stuff is on steam tho right

03
if you dont have a computer to run vr 500 bucks is good

03
sure but if youre looking for vr why dont you already have a good pc

03
I have parts ordered

03
yeah connors gonna upgrade his

03
i spent like 1k lol

03
yeah lul

03
if youre looking at VR then you should def have a good comp

03
i mean like it’s gonna have more then 4 gb of ram

03
id much rather have gamer comp than vr

03
4gb is probably below average nowadays

03
yeah lol

03
id bet 8 is average overall but 16 is average for gaming

03
but it’s what i’m working with rn

03
32

03
is 16 good for vr?

03
1024+ is like supercomp

03
16 probably fine for vr

03
ok

03
as long as you dont plan or recording or streaming it lul

03
yeah thats what i have

03
oh god no

03
why would i want to make myself look stupid online? i already do that in person

03
gg

03
ok so ye

03
but yeah i’ll actually be able to do stuff when it’s done

03
gg

03
yeah id only want vr if like everyone who we play with in our friend group also had it cuz singleplayer games are fun for a bit but im not gonna get a 400 dollar accesory to get bored after a week

03
makes sense

03
(thats why i want you to get vr)

03
oh shit is multiplayer beat saber a thing

03
nah dont think so

03
oh rip

03
honestly id probably just not get vr because jonathan never wants to play what i wanna play anyways and probably wouldnt want to do shit in vr with me either soooooooooooooo

03
still a big yike

03
that’d be neat tho

03
echo arena is REALLY good if you want good multiplayer games

03
?

03
yeah except no tho

03
oh you were talking to connor

03
continue

03
its free with a 10$ dlc

03
but like. what is it

03
its ultimate frisbee in space pretty much

03
0 grav frisbee

03
*oh*

03
but the dlc is a shooter

03
like a gun?

03
yes

03
yeah

03
gun game

03
in 0 g

03
does t shoot frisbees or bullets

03
l a z e r

03
yeah still a no from me dawg

03
so i can murder people mid frisbee game

03
no

03
oh rip

03
no theyre 2 modes

03
its a seperate gamemode

03
ah

03
ok so rift s right

03
yeah

03
ok

03
i’ll look into it

03
also i really want try vr minecraft for some reason

03
yeah if i ever got vr id wanna do like

03
vr mc and ttt

03
ttt?

03
trouble in terrorist town

03
i think there are actually clientside mods for vr minecraft

03
excuse me what

03
what is this toaster

03
doesnt seem that fun to me

03
i mean

03
it doesnt seem much more fun than echo combat

03
if there are 4 ppl
1 person is traitor (trying to kill everyone)
2 ppl are civilians (trying to survive)
1 person is detective (trying to find and kill traitor)

03
itd be rly fun prolly

03
oh nice

03
that sounds neat

03
but

03
as i said earlier

03
oh thats more than i thought it was

03
and as evidenced here

03
jonathan would not want to

03
oh i was thinking of oitc

03
its just otc but no

03
thatd be pp

03
yeah

03
although imagine mc minigames in vr

03
thats why i thought it would be pee pee

03
i’d be down if i ever get this

03
oh god

03
skywars vr

03
not the mini games

03
yeah i kinda wanna try that now

03
dragon escape

03
tnt run

03
but idk if it would be allowed on most servers

03
they usually ban clientside mods

03
thats a fact

03
maybe like dedicated vr servers

03
thosed be nice

03
do those exist?

03
some1 could join without vr and just wreck every1

03
eh

03
not much of a difference

03
uh

03
is vr mc a mod or its own thing

03
theres a dedicated vr app but its bedrock

03
isnt either bedrock edition which is PEEPEE GROSS or a mod

03
ok

03
yeah doing that csgo ripoff wtv its called would be fun in vr

03
pretty sure thats what ttt is in its like a mod for it

03
or a gamemode at least

03
pavlov

03
honestly yeah i’d be way more into cs:go in vr then i am the normal@game rn

03
i mean you keep saying vr shooters would be fun

03
but then you diss the vr shooter i like

03
yeah because 0 grav just takes away from it imo

03
0 grav makes it worse

03
i’d be down for that

03
if i ever get this that is

03
its not like ima get it anytime soon so

03
ok

03
but yeah if we do vr minecraft i’m gonna probably be a nerd and punch at the blocks instead of clicking

03
thats still the thing for me is like vr would probably be fun but its be *better* if walking wasnt just clicking a button to teleport

03
like even just that takes away so much to me

03
360 degree treadmill pls

03
i mean id like that but space

03
also that’d be pricey

03
"and though he was my stepfather, I always thought of him as Daddy."


03

03

04
Pinned a message.

04
might restart server world and stream

04
but im also feelina bit lazy

04
ok so i looked into the rift s it looks nice

04
the wire shoudlnt be super bad

04
if not there are accessories to get rid of it but it takes a lot of processing power pretty sure

04
jok

04
u shoudl joen

04
i have an AMD Ryzen 5

04
so i should be good

04
its on the recommended specs list

05
oh look its a person

05
?

05
me?

05
idk. are you a person?

05
no i am not sorry

05
then the other person

05
wait @JONKKKK is yours wireless/easy to set up at my house

05
or is the rift s easy to move

05
not really

05
there are a bunch of wires

05
what about the rift s

05
idk

05
it looks like one wire

05
yeah that might be easier

05
ok

05
we should do our own longest to stay in vr challenge

05
nnnnnnnnnnehhhh

05
its

05
yeah vr *hurts* after a while

05
oof

05
beat saber through the pain

05
like you get a headache if you play for more than like 3/4 hours

05
3 or 4**

05
oh ok

05
not 3/4 of an hour

05
i was like woah that aint good

05
is it because of the gear or just vr itself

05
kinda both

05
oof

05
some games are better than others

05
with echo vr you dont get motionsick at all since you actually are moving yourself, just with ur arms

05
***VR Chat***

05
echo vr?

05
is that a game or what.?

05
yeah its what i was talking about earlier

05
ah ok

05
space frisbee

05
but i mean an omnidirectional treadmill would be nice

05
especially for mc

**Remember kids, when a stranger walks up to you,** you have to stop and ask them to leave — you never can tell when a stranger will have a gun. They usually do, and when you point out to them what's going on in a situation, they won't even bother to listen, instead pointing a gun at your head.

That's why we must take to heart the lesson of the Lord's Prayer. It's really pretty simple. After all, if you don't stop them — especially right before you open your mouth — they will know exactly who was to attack them. And that, kids, is why the Lord spoke the words.

It's the only prayer we can trust, since the Lord uses it when he makes a judgment. Let's pray it before we point a gun at someone.

The words are so easy, you might want to learn them from a Bible. To help you hear them, here's the Bible's English translation:

Jesus said to them, "In the days of Noah, when the ark arched the flood, how was all that ark

**Remember kids, when a stranger walks up to you,** look their way and make eye contact (no more than 90 degrees, with the right eye) and if they don't immediately respond with "yes", don't act like you're giving them the cold shoulder and continue talking. They probably don't know you're talking to them, do they?

8. Always ask if your conversation partner knows you're dating. It doesn't matter if your partner is married, single or married with kids.

9. Ask why your partner is telling you their secrets, and not tell that to a stranger.

10. Don't ever let your curiosity get the best of you.

11. If you hear the word "hope" spoken about your relationship, shut up.

12. Don't expect your partner to be your girlfriend or wife or husband in the same way that you do.

13. Your relationship should be about you and your two people who love each other.

14. Do not treat your partner that way.

07
im gonna go commit bleach drink

07
*stop doing so much without me im already getting fomo and you guys havent even done that much*

07
that

07
yeah?

07
i was just mining and walked into a zombie spawner

07
i get fomo so fuckin bad

07
the alaska trip was painful

07
yeah but asking ppl to not play is kinda counterproductive

07
what

07
ok gtg brb

07
bye

07
sorry

07
welp

07
me too lul but how is that counterproductive, if ppl arent playing theres nothing to miss out on

07
imma go cry msyelf to sleep brb

07
if ppl are playing, even if they arent doing anything, *fomo*

07
yeah but you want a community

07
hey jonk

07
can you send me some bleach

07
@JONKKKK

07
but yeah you kinda want 2 things that cant happen

07
jonk the bleach

07
ik that fomo can suck but its kinda just gonna happen

07
jonk

07
ok

07
*you have mail*

07
good

07
no jonk like

07
i wouldnt be too concerned about it if i had confidence that were not all gonna just stop enjoying it once we get far enough

07
if i knew 100% that wed keep playing and having fun all together then it wouldnt really matter but when you have almost a time limit until people start getting bored its just fomo x 10

07
like having a community would be great b

07
ut i meant like 10

07


07
if we had a consistent like 20 ppl playing then i wouldnt rly get fomo because were all probably gonna keep playing

Have you ever noticed that when two teams are playing a basketball, and one team scores more points than the other, The team that scored the most points always wins?

10
Kind of a weird trend I discovered while praying

10
Would love to know what you all think of this wacky discovery or if anyone is able to offer up an explanation

10
what

10
its actualy a societal hangover from when the bougousie was in control, those who had the more money, or in this case, points were able to control whatever, and thus would win at society

10
Huh that explains a little bit but how could this be transferred to basketball? Players don't score money they score points which, for some odd reason, make a certain team win. It just doesn't add up

03
if were bein honest then im like chaotic neutral
nates lawful evil
quinns neutral evil
jonathans chaotic good

03
going off of descriptions of each one

03
thats the most accurate

03
you dont understand how this works

03
im either chaotic good or lawful good

03
youre chaotic good

03
explain

03
chaotic good is like they do what they want (usually kind and benevolent) but they dont care about what other people think of them and do things that may not agree with society

03
we live in a society

03
on the dnd server we do things like this, and im working on an extended alignment chart because of it

03
ooo what would it be?

03
my judgements are accurate

03
and you cant change my mind

03
i dont think quinn is neutral evil

03
hes not mean or anything

03
neutral evil is like "ill do whatever i can get away with"

03
ehh

03
no regard for laws

03
and uhhhhhhh

03
*vape*

03
dafuq do you think *I* am?

03
thats more true neutral imo

03

04

04
it just asked if I wanted to ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

04
owo

04
ok its for official game servers

04
but how do you add em

04
the channel has to look like this
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/539106814697013250/616766039698702346/unknown.png

04
YEAH BUT HOW DO YOU ADD EM

04
and next to the name of the channel it says follow

04
what

04
OH FOUND IT

04
that was kinda a bad explanation of how that works

04
how do you do it?

04
find a channel like that from an official game server and down where youd normally send messages it says follow

04
MINECRAFT #game

04
wait so how does it work

04
CallMeCarson Discord Cult #announcements

04
also you should add those to #announcements

04
meh #announcements is like OUR announcements

04
if you can call them announcements

04
i like the idea of them being in general

04
you should make a new channel so i can mute it

04
/s

04
(but only a little)

04
damn SCPU doesnt have their announcements channel set to an announcements channel

04
so i cant add it

04
broooooooooooo carson went on vsauce2's podcast bro

04
oh yeah gamers the devs of SCPU said they might add like a coop mode

04
almost 100% they wont add online like in SCPSL but like 2 player coop is a pretty big possibility

I know Satchel’s the only one that plays magic, but basically, this combo gives me 1 spicy point for every dude I have on the field, then Swahili can duplicate the amount of dudes I have, and then I can use all my new spicy points and convert it to damage that the red boi does, obliterating everything.

12
i just lost my deck

08
now you just need a setup to get the instant out of your graveyard

08
i feel like that would be a pain to deal with

09
oh yeah i have a bunch of stuff to get things from my graveyard

09
still missing tamiyo's journal but close enough

09
whats that?

09
artifact that makes clue tokens, and you can cash in 3 clues to search your library for any card and put it in your hand

09
ooo

09
i might want perpetual timepiece too but im not sure

10
basically i can toss a whole bunch of things in my graveyard and get them back by exiling perpetual timepiece

I’m doing a think

01
https://soundcloud.com/user

01
poll: If I did a video which would you prefer in the background
1) bowsa
2) whatever the fuck I just posted

01
would it be in the background?

01
because bg songs shouldnt have lyrics imo

01
It would be synced to

01
what would it be synced to? like an edit or a funny or...

01
Probably a gungeon edit

01
oh ok

01
i still like #1

01
a gungeon *edit*? like the dumb thing i made of jonathan kinda edit?

01
like csgo edit i assume

01
thats what i meant but ok

01
Yeah like a csgo edit but it’s not cs so I can meme the shit out of it

01
uh

01
theres nothing stopping you from meming the shit out of a csgo edit but ok

01
Yeah yeah I know

01
But also I succ at csgo

01
> implying you dont also suck at gungeon xdd

01
nah lul

01
I suc less

01
i assume youd want to style it like the casey edit wtv its called

01
Yeah

01
Kinda

01
OH NO

01
what

01
https://soundcloud.com/renim_g/when

01
This just came on

01
i must say that you can do whatever you want but starting out editing with an edit (ik sounds stupid but u get what im sayin) is probably not a good idea

01
like ive been editing for 5 years and im still ass at edits

01
but u do u

01

important video^^^^^^^^^^

05
the not bad computer exists

05
and is functional

05
fun fact optifine is acting like a web link

05
what

05
i download and click it. it decides to open in internet explorer and doesnt really do anything

05
right click

05
what file type is it

05
.jar

05
do you have java installed

05
i think so

05
https://java.com/en/download/

05
https://optifine.net/downloads

05
oh then no i dont\

05
ok its warning me that im using firefox

05
firefox kinda lame bro

05
gamer opera is where its at

05
what

05
https://www.opera.com/gx#start

05
best browser ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

05
looks nice

06
ok it still just doesnt

07
oof...

07
you installed the java?

07
i tried and it just doesnt repsond to clicking the button

07
im trying a different browser

07
wait the download link?

07
on the optifine website?

07
yeah

07
it worked on my other comp

07
click (mirror)

07
ok

07
yeah it doesnt work either

07
what does it do?

07
when you click (mirror)?

07
it opens to the download link that saves and does stuff with internet explorer when clicked

07
Google chrome og browser

07
Open the downloaded file from file manager?

07
same thing

07
Opens IE?

07
Uugh

07
yep

07
tHe BeSt WeB bRoWsEr

07
Right click the file, click on properties.

07
Then send a screenshot of each of the tabs in the window that opens

07
i can change the open location but none makes sense

07
like oh yeah lemme open it with notepad

07
Heckity heck try googling ".jar opening in internet explorer"

07
ok i can change it except none of the other options make any sense

07
again do the google

07
i did

07
that was the solution

07
answers.microsoft.com/en

07
do i really need optifine tho?

07

07
You talk too much, @Zildin. You just advanced to level 14.

07

07
i mean yeah but if it doesnt like existing then do i need to try super hard on this?

07
yes

07
or wait a while and try in a week or 2

07
or use linux

07
i mean i dont

09
@Zildin you can probably just right click

Slipstream is trash

12
you play dota you obv have no idea whats trash and what isnt

12
Didn’t mean to offend you toaster

12
It’s just an opinion bro chill

12
you could have worded that better

12
"I don't like slipstream"
"slipstream isn't that good imo"
"slipstream isn't my kind of game"
"I don't like slipstream's graphics"

12
You realize anything toaster likes I say is trash to get a rise out of him

12
I’ve legit never heard of slipstream

12
You yourself know I play nothing but DotA

12
Regardless I appreciate the advice

04
congrats. you played yourself

04
btw. worldmap and optifine is not compatible

04
ok?

04
so dont use worldmap

04
ok, then you won't get those nice cursed images in mc

04
wot

04
just switch versions when you wanna make those

04
i'm lazy

04
¯\_(ツ)_/¯

04
dynmap is a waste of time

04
lmao

04
ok?

04
im not saying get dynmap

04
im saying stop using the forge client and use the optifine, or defult, one

04
ok. now. give me the reason why i should not use it?

04
give me a very very good and valid reason

04
because you cant play on the server if you do

04
and i'll remove it when playing on your server

04
^ That's not a good and valid reason

04
¯\_(ツ)_/¯

04
ah. i see. you think i'm cheating? cheater

04
nah not rly

04
good. then why should i remove the worldmap mod?

04
why *shouldn't* you?

04
because you cannot play on the server with it

04
you still did not give a valid reason

04
if you want to play on the server

04
you cannot use it

04
because it is the rule

04
who cares why the rule is there

04
it is a rule

04
if you do not follow it

04
you cannot play

04
neither can you lmao

04
correct?

04
im not using any clientside mods other than optifine

04
you mean in

04
no?

04
why are you cheating?

04
tbh. gm3 is cheating

04
im sorry to alert you to this fact but im not

04
+ you are abusing your op

04
ok well then if you host a server you can make it against the rules

04
yeah

04
ikr

04
well. show me the rules

04
yeah we use it in place of a cam account

04
*visible confusion*

04
the rules are pinned in announcements

04
we would use alt accounts to see things from a distance but we dont have $30 to blow on that

04
i have an alt but

04
sauron your argument makes no sense

04
im not gonna use a whole second account just to look at buildings

04
neither do your

04
yeah. i see now

04
what

04
Am I missing something or do these responses make no sense in context.

04
no what hes saying just doesnt really make sense

04
mkay

04

04
my internet is wack on rare occasion

@Toaster

good

04
ill do it next time i stream/play

04

also. don't call me Sauron in mc, since the account JasonDrucker is NOT affiliated with it.

04
?

04
Just saying

04
what

04
what does that mean

05
its ur account, right??

05
yes. I own it

05
tho. it's not affiliated to it.

05
w d y m

05
what does that even mean

05
What

05
you can call SauronBSMC Sauron, but not that alt lol

05
i don't want that acc involved

05
involved with what

05
and why would us calling your account sauron be negative in any way

05
i won't argue with you lol

05
I should be sleeping, and so do you.

05
its 5pm

05
It’s 5 lol

05
im not tryna argue im just tryna understand why us saying "Sauron" instead of "Jason" would affect anything

05
and also yeah its 5

05
it's 1 am here

05
You talk too much, @SauronBSMC. You just advanced to level 7.

05
maybe dont live in the EU xddd

05

05

05
This is America

05
dont got u trippin up

05
ah. nice

05
no offense, but Murica' fuck yeah

05
lmao we dont live in france hes just weird

05
america kinda ass doe

05
yeah

05
america == pee poo

05
When you scared to goto school

05
well. i heard florida is always hot.

05
+ a hurricane is coming

05
were like 26th in the world for education cuz our system is shit and we also have an orange as our overlord

05
It’s humid in Florida

05
Not our school tho toast

05
+ yeah, school shootings are bad. it's because of un

05
yeah our schools pretty good but compared to the rest of the world its still ass

05
Like I said people in nc still learning bout polynomials

05
its also because you can literally buy guns at walmart

05
nobody likes florida

05
never was in america.. 😦

05
florida is the bad part of the bad part of the world

05
Bruh I was born in Florida :(

05
but you escaped

05
Scp:Florida

05
SCP: contain florida

05
also this is a little fuckin insane https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRHYXDM3jlk

05
niiice

05
stuff at like 3:30

05
really like 3:00

05
What part of eu you live bro

05
> ue

05
well. gun laws are not the problem in the school shooting scenario. Bullying is..

05
Ueropean Enion.

05
i feel like its kinda both

05
Gun laws *and* bullying.

05
kinda just overall shit

05
They have bullying all over.

05
yeah, it's everywhere. even EU

05
But the shit schools and radicalization from social media make it worse.

05
And then said radicalized wanker gets a gun.

05
americas both like "oh this person has a mental illness that we didnt check or notice at all because we dont pay attention to our students whatsoever? lets give him a gun its fine"

05
And some poor schmuk in a math class learns that bullet+body=bad

05
actually a lot of mass shooters *aren't* diagnosed with any kind of mental illness

05
Americanism

05
sure but they dont check for it when you buy a gun

05
They do?

05
they don't check anything as far as i got to know

05
might be wrong

05
Most shooters are under 18 and buy their gun illegally

05
School^

05
sure but that still just shows how easy it is to a q u i r e f i r e p o w e r

05
all i know is that you go to texas, you go to a gun shop, and get a gun just like that

05
or steal from parents

05
You can’t get a handgun under 21 in any state

05
That is where gun

05
The only stricting that would make sense would be a requirement to lock guns in safes. not just let them lie around.

05
i mean maybe

05
Eh

05
but anyone can open a safe if they know the combo

05
My phone finna die lol

05
gg

05
that is where bullying part comes in.

05
gg ez no re

05
Most shootings are started by bullying

05
yes we all agree

05
its just not *only* bullying

05
being mean to someone isnt gonna make then shoot up a school

05
but its a factor

05
yup

05
people are dickwads and they should be less dickwadish..

05
i know why theres so many shootings

05
Some are just outright anger, frustration, and emotions

05
You talk too much, @HollowRisk. You just advanced to level 9.

05
its the VIDEO GAMES

05

05
Minecraft needs to be banned

05

05
obviously

05
Ah my favorite tutorial how to shoot up a school

05
you got walmart there?

05
yes

05
We don’t

05
well not where we live but

05
i believe you can buy firearms there

05
in the us in general yes

05
Yeah I was just at a Walmart

05
Pinned a message.

05
We walked by the station

05
I got Mario loaded up and I’m ready to go

05
i don't know if the weapons in walmart are just airguns, or normal firearms (9mm, .22LR, .45ACP etc)

05
Normal firearms

05
Most are just hunting rifles tho

05
i only saw  airguns on website lol

05
You need to goto a gun store if you what ar

05
yeah, i know that.

05
I was just there and I can confirm that they where firearms

05
They had scopes aswell

05
can you get guns online?

05
No

05
Only dark web

05
wouldnt that have to be like dark web? yeah ok

05
in sweden you need to take an hunter's exam just to get started on a license.

05
you need approved safe etc.

05
You need to take a test to hunt with a gun

05
however, airguns are totally legal as long as they don't exceed 10J

05
But to buy one is only an age requirement I’m pretty sure

05
yes

05
18+

05
You Swedish?

05
good thing I'm 22 lol

05
yes

05
Ever heard of admiralbulldog

yall wanna do another homestuck ripoff and/or another dumb dnd game

07
i feel like doing another hs ripoff just cuz its fun to draw that dumb stuff lul

07
id be down

07
would you be down to draw one aswell? its interesting to have 2

07
since u wanna get better at art anyways

07
we could make it so people can call dibs on drawing the next panel by reacting

07
what

07
like

07
no

07
aww

07
i think itd be cool to be like

07
>do this

07
> do it with the space boomer

07
and then i do the next panel

07
nah that doesnt look as cool

07
> ok boomer

07
>> no u

07
hah what a boomer

07
> i know thats not how you do it

07
id be down to try that, but reacting is slow

07
eh its not that bad

07
i think

07
ok

07
i could write a relatively simple bot that just deletes a message if it says "ill draw" and then says "{User} is drawing next!"

07
eh

07
reacting seems cleaner imo

07
guess 2kx2k

07
you can react to your own command to draw it

07
i had to leave for dessert btw thats why i was gone

07
but you can draw your own command, just cant draw twice in a row

07
?

07
you should be able to draw twice in a row imo

07
thats just me tho

07
meh i think its better if it switches

07
but we could do you can do multiple times

07
we could just have a limit like

07
you cant draw more than 4 times in a row

07
also i dont think you should be able to draw your own command

07
what

07
bruh

07
im willing to change not being able to draw twice in a row but like

07
alright ok

07
right now, if you cant draw your own command, ill just draw infinitely until some other person eventually notices the new channel

07
tru

07
see ok

07
heres something

07
maybe you should be able to command after you drew?

07
so you can draw your own command, you can draw as many times in a row as you want, but can you make a command after you drew

07
yeah

07
and not draw your own command?

07
meh

07
i think it should be

07
you can do a command after your own drawing, but you cant draw that command

07
but if you do a command on someone elses drawing, you can draw it

07
yeah yeah

07
so you cant go 3 times in a row

07
ok

07
yeah

07
Someone needs to so the shit on the table command.

07

you destroyed my life.
you annihilated my hopes
and eradicated my dreams.
i will obliterate your skeleton
and grind it to a pulp
then mix the pulp with water
and drink it.
so,
from the bottom of my heart,
fuck you.

with a burning passion.
i was just trying to have a good time

you destroyed my life.

and eradicated my dreams.
i will obliterate your skeleton
and grind it to a pulp
then mix the pulp with water
and drink it.

from the bottom of my heart,
fuck you.

10
Understand

10
¯\_(ツ)_/¯

10
i know it intuitively

10
but i cant teach it

10
Guess

10
I'll

10
Just

10
ded

10
Take the L

10
It's fine

10
I know it

10
One sec

10
Actually?

10
(10.5,1.5)

10
But like

10
How

10
Ok

10
So

10
Also I'm more confused with the first two

10
(9,3)

10
Oh

10
But do continue

10
9

10
3

10
One sec

10
4.5

10
ok

10
The length for number 2 is exactly 9.486832980505138 but could also be made as ✔90

10
Woaj

10
how'd you

10
Ok

10
So you know the pythagorean theorem

10
xavier big brian

10
Yea

10
Ok

10
So I look at it as a triangle

10
High 3 base 9

10
So I did 9^2 + 3^2 = 90

10
(81) + (9) = 90

10
That makes a little more sense

10
So I square rooted that boi

10
And got 9.486832980505138

10
But that number has the big gay

10
Lmao

10
So write ✔90

10
√ 90?

10
But you could also use the distance formula but that formula also has the big gay

10
Yes

10
Ok

10
I’m on mobile so I can type that

10
What is the distance formula

10
I just added space between the two

10
I'm also on mobile

10
Some gay ass formula to calculate the distance for the lines

10
Oh

10
Idk the formula because I forgot it

10
Oop

10
So I just use the therom

10
Also the formula is dum

10
Oki

10
It’s just as dumb as standard form

11
I wield a full gross of reaction pics

08
im re adding servers to my list

08
¯\_(ツ)_/¯

08

but different port

08

08
idk which one

08

09
yo what was the thing that makes .jar files work

09
literally just google search "jar file fix"

09
oh so java never installed

09
that makes sense

09
its big brain time

09
fun its still not working

09
ok i just needed jarfix

07
hey jonk what software are you guys using to host a sevtech server

08
why does everyone keep asking jonathan about hosting and such

08
i am the one who hosts all the servers and the one who knows stuff like ips

08
just sayin

08
jonathans tried to host a server like twice and i dont think its worked either time

08
maybe one of them worked?

08
ok, sorry i didnt know who was hosting and jonathan was a safe bet

08
connor just also asked jonathan about sevtech (i dont even remember what it was but it was something that i could answer and jonathan could not) so since you just asked him like connor did i just wanted to say "bruh"

08
and ot answer your question, we arent using any software (well probably not what youre thinking of at least)

08
this is the server
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/539106814697013250/620270568360640512/unknown.png

10
i was asking for the non

10
yeah but you asked jonathan about the non

10
and as i said hes hosted like 2 servers total

10
modded or non modded

11
I just need the ip to the non modded one

11
i dont care about hosting for it

11
yeah its the same ip just a diff port

11
what port

11
but its not up and prolly wont be for a while lul

03
Hmm

03
I have no clue how I screwed that up so bad

03
I’m trying to make a quesadilla

03
And I burnt the shit out of it

03
i figured it out

03
there was too much heat for such a small thermal capacity

03
so you cooked it too much?

03
yeah

03
now that you say it that way

03
lol

03
i dont think in laymans terms

https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/539106814697013250/620411067956199424/472px

06
im scared

06
so what im hearing is i got medium skill level and low challenge level

06
yeah

06
but that doesnt take into account motivation or work ethic

06
its from this video

06
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zna9

06
which is something ive done on accident before

06
i didnt know it was called flow

07
i called it the timeless void

07
but it dont take into account motivation

which is like 100% of why i dont do things

07
gaming or not

07
fair

07
i dont believe that cart because it implies that i have a medium to high skill level

07
yeah honestly that chart isnt super accurate

07
cuz challenge level differs for different skill levels

if youre low skill lvl, something really easy is a big challenge for you

07
yeah

07
and if youre high skill level, something thats high challenge would be really fuccin difficult

07
wait but what about medium skill level and medium challenge

07
It doesnt exist\

07
no enemy can be perfectly centered

this is a momentous occasion

let us celebrate with my oldest bottle of rotting grape juice

:GWbowsuBlobThinkOwO:

06
i hath made yet another csgo map

06

06
the map has been made and is playable

06

06
well yes its my layout for the one with the pole in the center but theres no pole in the center because i made it too small

06
