[13] Toaster#0403
hey jok

[19] Toaster#0403
heyo neyto

[19] Toaster#0403
why have you not existed like all day

[19] GoldenPot8o#2294
Just didn’t feel like it

[19] GoldenPot8o#2294
I decided not to exist today

[19] Toaster#0403
well you missed the premiere screening of the news episode

[19] GoldenPot8o#2294
Eh

[19] Toaster#0403
and also lost the opportunity to record the next one

[19] GoldenPot8o#2294
Really?

[19] Toaster#0403
mhm

[19] GoldenPot8o#2294
How was it explained is all I care about

[19] Toaster#0403
what do u meen

[19] GoldenPot8o#2294
How was my absence explained

[19] Toaster#0403
oh we didnt record it

[19] GoldenPot8o#2294
?

[19] GoldenPot8o#2294
What

[19] Toaster#0403
i was saying we coulda recorded it

[19] GoldenPot8o#2294
Oh

[19] Toaster#0403
everyone was online and ready to do it except u

[19] GoldenPot8o#2294
Nah it’s ok

[19] GoldenPot8o#2294
Idrc

[19] Toaster#0403
its annoyin for me tho

[19] Toaster#0403
cuz i do in fact enjoy editing

[19] Toaster#0403
and also it woulda been a really fun one to record since we all switch places

[19] GoldenPot8o#2294
We already suck at uploading on time

[19] Toaster#0403
also now it is canon that liam is better than u at science and you always try to be way cooler than him and either mess up or he does better and u cant no u because you werent here

[19] GoldenPot8o#2294
And this was like one time compared to jonk and Liam’s like 20 times each

[19] Toaster#0403
yeah that makes it worse

[19] GoldenPot8o#2294
What

[19] Toaster#0403
because the ONE TIME they were both here is the ONE TIME you WERENT here

[19] Toaster#0403
literally any other day probably woulda been better

[19] GoldenPot8o#2294
Jonk is because he has gay ok

[19] Toaster#0403
wot

[19] GoldenPot8o#2294
Jon

[19] Toaster#0403

yes

[19] Toaster#0403
you are correct

[19] Toaster#0403
but how is that relevant

[19] GoldenPot8o#2294
That is why he doesn’t do things

[19] GoldenPot8o#2294

@everyone https://skribbl.io/?SLSnmrrvA0

[21] Serendipity#3758
I just spent 10 minutes doing that...

[06] Alterae#0258
So, school is closed today, apparently.

[07] GoldenPot8o#2294
Attention everyone, be on the look out for a mended schedule for this week, as it’s now cut down to 3 days.

[07] Serendipity#3758
Oof

[07] GoldenPot8o#2294
'Cause you're yes then you're cold
You're in then you're no
You're up then you're out
You're hot then you're down

[07] Serendipity#3758
No

[07] GoldenPot8o#2294
To the tune of Katy Perry’s hot n cold

[07] Serendipity#3758
Cause you're hot then you're cold
You're yes, then you're no
You're in, then you're out
You're up, then you're down
You're wrong when it's right

[07] Serendipity#3758
That's the actual lyrics

[07] Alterae#0258
I think he knows that...

[07] Serendipity#3758

[20] Toaster#0403
its fortnight but it hasnt been taken over by 8 year olds yet

[20] JONKKKK#4186
they took fortnite and improved literally everything

[20] Toaster#0403
but it HAS been taken over by jok and thats just as bad

[20] Toaster#0403
also what jonathan

[20] Toaster#0403
its like

[20] Toaster#0403
almost the same thing

[20] JONKKKK#4186
yeah but better in every aspect

[20] Toaster#0403
not rly

[20] JONKKKK#4186
the movement is WAY better

[20] Toaster#0403
main difference: different setting

[20] JONKKKK#4186
the dropping is better

[20] Toaster#0403
also you can slide

[20] JONKKKK#4186
the map is better

[20] Toaster#0403
uh

[20] Toaster#0403

[20] Serendipity#3758
So it's even more magical then that other one

[20] Toaster#0403
mhm

[20] Toaster#0403
extra magical

[20] GoldenPot8o#2294
Actually levels are effectively made up internet currency to exchange for ranks, so it’s not that magical but you didn’t hear that from me

[20] Serendipity#3758

[20] Toaster#0403
you can create the http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-10000 page and then when SCP gets up to 10000 the 10k page is already yours

[20] Toaster#0403
YOU COULD MAKE A -001 PAGE

[20] Toaster#0403
http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp/-001

[20] GoldenPot8o#2294
You know music bots?

[20] Toaster#0403

[20] GoldenPot8o#2294
What if you did it so Marv could play scp readings like music bots

[20] Toaster#0403

[21] Toaster#0403
then howd they find the original post?????????????????????????

[21] JONKKKK#4186
by sorting by new and getting lucky

[21] Toaster#0403
and also you didnt include any images of the pack just a download link thats sorta very annoying maybe dont do that???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????

[21] JONKKKK#4186
ok fINE ill add images

[21] Toaster#0403
like that turns ppl off who didnt know about the original post because theyd have to download the pack just to see if they like it?????????????????????????????????????????????okthats better thanks jok

[22] Toaster#0403
the above was said by a robotic priest, pretending to shoot the last three humans alive with finger guns

[22] Toaster#0403
the last three humans alive wasnt being pretended, just the finger guns part

[22] JONKKKK#4186
wait so did he kill them or not

[22] Toaster#0403
nono he was trying to kill/smite them but hes delusional so nothing was actually happening

[22] JONKKKK#4186
like what im getting is:
1. he was just pretending that the last 3 humans were alive
2. he killed them with real guns pretending that he killed them with finger guns

oh ok

[22] JONKKKK#4186
but you have to admit

[22] JONKKKK#4186
"the last three humans alive wasnt being pretended, just the finger guns part"

[22] Toaster#0403
nah there are only 3 ppl alive (5 rly) and he was pretending to shoot them

[22] Toaster#0403
while stqnding on another (dying) robot who has an erection

[22] JONKKKK#4186
i get that but what did "the last three humans alive wasnt being pretended" mean because i can't decipher that

[22] JONKKKK#4186
and *nice*

[22] JONKKKK#4186
sounds like a quality book

[07] JONKKKK#4186

[07] JONKKKK#4186
and then later (still hypnotized)

[07] JONKKKK#4186
he tries to order a tomato pizza with no crust or cheese

[18] MEE6#4876
You talk too much, @Serendipity. You just advanced to level 2.

[18] Serendipity#3758
No wait

[18] Serendipity#3758
Why

[18] Toaster#0403
wish discord was more open source

[18] Toaster#0403
rocket.chat looks neat but also no vc and also elss well-known

[18] Toaster#0403
but fully open source

[18] Toaster#0403
:Thonk:

[18] JONKKKK#4186
nah fam im good

[18] Toaster#0403
what

[18] JONKKKK#4186
i wouldnt want to move to rocket.chat if thats what youre suggesting

[18] Toaster#0403
nono im just saying its an epic gamer because its open source

[18] Toaster#0403
open source  = good

[18] JONKKKK#4186
ok lol

[18] Toaster#0403
thats one of the main reasons atom = good

[18] Alterae#0258
Rice chat looks pretty good.

[18] Alterae#0258
Rocket chat

[18] Toaster#0403
rocket?

[18] Toaster#0403
lol

[18] Alterae#0258
Autocorrect

[18] Alterae#0258
Gah

[18] Toaster#0403
i wonder if rocket is unblocked at school..?

[18] Toaster#0403
owo

[18] Alterae#0258
But yeah, if they added VC, i would seriously consider it.

[18] Alterae#0258
Because open source is nice.

[18] Alterae#0258
And that's why I use Linux.

[18] Toaster#0403
id use linux if it could actually run .exes

[18] Toaster#0403
but until then no thakns

[18] Toaster#0403
and *no, i dont want to use wine or wtv it is*

[18] Alterae#0258
Actually, it looks like rocket chat does have VC maybe?
But I see what you mean.

[18] Alterae#0258
Wine is tricky.

[18] JONKKKK#4186
?

[18] Alterae#0258
I just dual-boot.

[18] JONKKKK#4186
autocorrect?

[18] Alterae#0258
No

[18] Toaster#0403
?

[18] Alterae#0258
Wine is tricky.

[18] Toaster#0403
oh wine?

[18] Toaster#0403
wine is a program

[18] Toaster#0403
supposed to let you run exes on linux (and mac since mac is just a linux os)

[18] Toaster#0403
but very complicated and hard to get working

[18] Toaster#0403
not worth it imo

[18] Alterae#0258
Mac is unix.

[18] Alterae#0258
Not Linux

[18] Alterae#0258
Linux is also unix

[18] Toaster#0403
''''''''''''*same thing xd*''''''''''''

[18] Toaster#0403
u know what a mean

[18] Alterae#0258
Similar, ya.

[18] Alterae#0258
But Linux is better

[18] Toaster#0403
shore

[18] Alterae#0258
The reason Linux doesn't use exes is because it used other app formats.

[18] Alterae#0258
Not as neat as .app in Mac, tho.

[18] Toaster#0403
yeah but it means you cant run like 90% of games and also not many programs

[18] Alterae#0258
.app is really easy to manage if you aren't a Dev

[18] Alterae#0258
And us

[18] Alterae#0258
Ya

[18] Toaster#0403
not 100% sure about programs but still jeesussss

[18] Alterae#0258
Programs are usually cross-platform, at least the good ones.

[18] Alterae#0258
But games are an issue.

[18] Alterae#0258
Which is why I dual boot.

[18] Toaster#0403
yeah but then i feel like id just never use the linux side

[18] Alterae#0258
Also, Windows works better on touch yuck screen.

[18] Alterae#0258
Ya, you probably wouldn't.

[18] Alterae#0258
I often don't use it.

[18] Toaster#0403
cus yes i like linux for the customizability but id just have everything on the windoos siide

[18] Alterae#0258
Microsoft should just make a Linux distro.

[18] Alterae#0258
Windows 11

[18] Alterae#0258
Penguin edition

[18] Toaster#0403
id take it

[18] Alterae#0258
Honestly, so would I.

[18] JONKKKK#4186
distro?

[18] Alterae#0258
The convenience of Windows *and* the stability, versatility, and freedom of Linux?  Sign me up.

[18] MEE6#4876
You talk too much, @Alterae. You just advanced to level 2.

[18] Alterae#0258

[18] Alterae#0258

[18] Toaster#0403
oh yeah i forgot control panel existed

[18] Alterae#0258
I think

[18] Alterae#0258
Yes

[18] Toaster#0403
i was just looking in settings and nvidia settings

[18] Alterae#0258
They should kill it

[18] Alterae#0258
And just use settings

[18] Toaster#0403

[22] GoldenPot8o#2294
I was in bed just chilling with my headphones in playing on my PS4, then I hear the slightest hint of a weird musical melody. I take my headphones off. It’s my Alexa; she’s playing Cha cha slide. I say “Alexa, stop” in my firmest voice. The music quiets down. I think I’ve won, but oh boy was I wrong. She says to me “The time is 1:17 AM” and begins blasting that cursed song again. I tell her to stop over and over but she doesn’t listen. I reach over to unplug her. The wire comes out with little resistance. Her last words haunt me to this day... “Slide to the l-”

[15] JONKKKK#4186
i made a fish and an alien tree

[15] GoldenPot8o#2294
Ok

[15] JONKKKK#4186
(mostly because i dont have brown lol)

[15] Toaster#0403
what- oh

[15] Toaster#0403
wtf lol

[15] GoldenPot8o#2294
I was wondering what the fuck that first think is

[15] JONKKKK#4186
and i think i know why i got snapped

[15] JONKKKK#4186
in dankmemes

[15] JONKKKK#4186
its because i usually post at night

[15] Toaster#0403
yeah idk i think 3D pens are sorta just a fad cuz unless you get *really fuccin good* you wont be able to make anything useful

[15] Toaster#0403
also jok prolly not

[15] JONKKKK#4186
well *yeah*

[15] Toaster#0403
prolly because they just dont have a good bot

[15] JONKKKK#4186
its not supposed to make things useful

[15] JONKKKK#4186
its supposed to make art

[15] JONKKKK#4186
useful things are for 3d printers

[15] Toaster#0403
but even then its like

[15] Toaster#0403
not very good art lol

[15] Toaster#0403
i think of it as something that you show someone when they come over to your house for the first time and then let them mess around with it for an hour and then youre both bored

[15] Toaster#0403
its kinda like “hey thats neat but also why”

[15] Toaster#0403
wtv i wont mess with ur fun lol

[15] Toaster#0403
but yeah the r/dankmemes thing is dumb

[15] Toaster#0403
shoulda just

[15] JONKKKK#4186
i at least think its fun lol

[15] JONKKKK#4186
but yeah it is

[15] Toaster#0403
well hm

[15] JONKKKK#4186
article 13 doesnt even apply to memes

[15] Toaster#0403
what? yes it does

[15] Toaster#0403
thats not why its dumb tho

[15] Toaster#0403
even if it didnt apply to memes r/dankmemes is the *only* sub whos acted on it, and its retarded that they did because it isnt even in effect yet and the individual subreddits wouldnt need to do anything, reddit as a website would

[15] Toaster#0403
so the mods of dankmemes just actually have two braincells

[15] Toaster#0403
collectively

[15] Alterae#0258
Actually one of them got lost last week.  So now they're only one brain cell and they all have to share.

[15] Toaster#0403
ack

[21] JONKKKK#4186
i only really have bright colors rn but ill have browns n greys n stuff soonish

[21] Serendipity#3758
Or a red bucket

[21] GoldenPot8o#2294
999 is probably easiest

[21] JONKKKK#4186
ooo i would make 999 but im out of orange

[21] Zildin#0532
frick

[21] JONKKKK#4186
well i have like half a stick

[21] Serendipity#3758
You could do Rudolph the red nosed reindeer

[21] GoldenPot8o#2294
Why

[21] JONKKKK#4186
oooo i feel like a giraffe would be fun to make

[21] Serendipity#3758
The true question is why not

[21] JONKKKK#4186
but i think im kinda low on yellow

[21] Zildin#0532
Wait how sturdy is the 3d drawn stuff?

[21] JONKKKK#4186
im low on basically everything at this point lmao

[21] JONKKKK#4186
and its pretty sturdy

[21] JONKKKK#4186
like

[21] GoldenPot8o#2294
Not very if you do it wrong tho

[21] Zildin#0532
Make a switch stand that isnt a ig gay kickstand

[21] JONKKKK#4186
depends on how big it is but its not fragile

[21] Serendipity#3758
I have my 3D pen lying around somewhere

[21] JONKKKK#4186
ehhhh thats more a job for 3d printing

[21] GoldenPot8o#2294
Mines broken

[21] Zildin#0532

[21] Zildin#0532
I should get one

[21] Zildin#0532

[21] Zildin#0532
idk

[21] JONKKKK#4186
wait what you guys have 3d pens??

[21] Zildin#0532
I wish

[21] GoldenPot8o#2294
You know this

[21] Serendipity#3758
I do.. probably in storage tho

[21] JONKKKK#4186
you could probably just come over to my house sometime and make some stuff

[21] Zildin#0532
yeah maybe

[21] JONKKKK#4186
but the filament is EXPENSIVE lmao

[21] GoldenPot8o#2294
I could do the 999

[21] GoldenPot8o#2294
Yeah

[21] Serendipity#3758
Idk where you live

[21] JONKKKK#4186
i spent like 30 bucks earlier today ordering a couple packs

[21] JONKKKK#4186
i found a pack of flex filament for like 5 bucks

[21] Zildin#0532
nice

[21] MEE6#4876
You talk too much, @Zildin. You just advanced to level 3.

[21] GoldenPot8o#2294
When I got mine my grandparents also got me a big filament box with like 200 ft of like any color I could want

[21] Serendipity#3758
Oh wow

[21] JONKKKK#4186
JESUS

[21] Zildin#0532
Wait jonk make a kirby

[21] JONKKKK#4186
OO thats good

[21] JONKKKK#4186

[21] GoldenPot8o#2294
Which is why I’m big sad that it’s broken

[21] JONKKKK#4186
because its late

[21] JONKKKK#4186
is it like spools of filament?

[21] GoldenPot8o#2294
Yeah

[21] Serendipity#3758
What kind of 3D pen did you had

[21] JONKKKK#4186
oooof

[21] JONKKKK#4186
with mine it spins while going in so i cant really do rolls of it

[21] GoldenPot8o#2294
But they were specifically for that pen

[21] Zildin#0532

[19] GoldenPot8o#2294

[19] JONKKKK#4186
but yeah we just ordered a replacement

[20] Toaster#0403
wow nice seems really worth the buy

[20] JONKKKK#4186
oh nah replacements free

[20] Toaster#0403
100% would get one just for it to break in two days

[20] JONKKKK#4186
tbh having a blast with it

[20] Toaster#0403
little more than two days

[20] JONKKKK#4186
its  f r e e

[20] JONKKKK#4186
(replacement is)

[20] Toaster#0403
im glad u got this while im on vaca cuz then youll be bored of it when i get back

[20] Toaster#0403
hopefully

[20] Toaster#0403
shkulda gotten it earlier

[20] Toaster#0403
wish there was more of a playerbase for duck game cuz none of you play it and its hard to find an online match cuz its not super popular

[20] Toaster#0403
been wanting to play it lots recently for no reason

[20] Toaster#0403
also just a thing i never said that it costed money @JONKKKK i was just saying it sounds very extraordinarily sturdy if youre gonna have to replace it every other week

[20] Toaster#0403
also do you just not care about your nickname or like that one a bunch cuz its been that for a little while

[20] Toaster#0403
same with nate but nate set his own

[20] Toaster#0403
idk i just expect ppl to change their name when i change it for them lol

[20] JONKKKK#4186
lol just havent gotten around to it

[20] JONKKKK#4186
UNTIL NOW

[20] Toaster#0403
that name is illegal

[20] JONKKKK#4186
(but also seriously whos dr bright)

[20] Toaster#0403
anyone who doesnt know dr bright or dr clef should be sacrificed

[20] Toaster#0403
to dr bright or dr clef

[20] JONKKKK#4186
pls explain

[20] Toaster#0403
@GoldenPot8o change ur nick to dr clef lol

[20] Toaster#0403
hol up

[20] JONKKKK#4186
you can do it for him

[20] Toaster#0403
http://www.scp-wiki.net/the-things-dr-bright-is-not-allowed-to-do-at-the-foundation

[20] Toaster#0403
that should give a pretty good representarion of his character (at least in the best canon xd)

[20] Toaster#0403
if that article isnt canon for you then youre doing it wrong

[20] JONKKKK#4186
alrighty so basically hes the best

[20] Toaster#0403
yes correct thanks

[20] Toaster#0403
http://www.scp-wiki.net/drclef-member-page

[20] JONKKKK#4186
so basically you should change your nickname

[20] JONKKKK#4186
/s

[20] JONKKKK#4186
(((but only a bit)))

[20] Toaster#0403
seese

[20] Toaster#0403
dr clef is second best thx

[20] JONKKKK#4186
whats he like?

[20] Toaster#0403
reed above link pls

[20] JONKKKK#4186
*"first came to the attention of the Foundation after publishing a seminal research paper, "On the use of Human Semen to ████ ███████ ██ █████ █████████,""*

[20] Toaster#0403
yes

[20] JONKKKK#4186
ok so what im getting is that he just doesnt give a single f

[20] Toaster#0403
if i ever make an actually functional scp game theres gonna be a 1/1000 chance that onstead of spawning as a scientist you spawn as dr bright and your job is just to kill everything

[20] Toaster#0403
you start with an inventory full of micros and just

[20] Toaster#0403
k i l l e v e r y t h i n g

[20] JONKKKK#4186
not 1 in 1000

[20] JONKKKK#4186
1 in 50 seems good

[20] JONKKKK#4186
like

[20] JONKKKK#4186
1 in 50 scientists

[20] Toaster#0403
1 in 100 at the LEAST

[20] Toaster#0403
nonon

[20] Toaster#0403
every person who spawns as a scoentist (it picks classes first, so scp, dboi, scientist, etc) generates a random number 1-1000 and if its 1 they become dr bright

[20] Toaster#0403
if two people get it in the same game one is dr clef

[20] JONKKKK#4186
nah i feel like it should be more common than that

[20] Toaster#0403
so its like

[20] Toaster#0403
v rare

[20] Toaster#0403
but it makes for a fun game for bright/clef lol

[20] JONKKKK#4186
because i feel like it would be a fun easter egg but also a fun game mechanic

[20] Toaster#0403
i recently like very low chance thingsyo

[20] Toaster#0403
u saw my most recent idea in #deleted-channel

[20] Toaster#0403
rite

[20] JONKKKK#4186
yeah

[20] JONKKKK#4186
the thing is you dont realise how low of a chance something is until you have to roll for it

[20] JONKKKK#4186
like

[20] JONKKKK#4186
1 in 20 is still PRETTY rare

[20] JONKKKK#4186
like

[20] JONKKKK#4186
thats a 5% chance

[20] JONKKKK#4186
(((not with the plugin)))

[20] Toaster#0403
*wakes up one month from now
gets on computer
opens discord
starts typing to jonathan
**EARRAPENITE***

[20] Toaster#0403
also too low

[20] JONKKKK#4186
(((i kinda get it with the plugin)))

[20] Toaster#0403
it needs to be more rare

[20] Toaster#0403
in game i can sorta see more common

[20] JONKKKK#4186
but yeah the dr bright thing should be 1 in 50 imo

[20] JONKKKK#4186
maybe like

[20] Toaster#0403
but since its literally like

[20] Toaster#0403
cant die and kills everything

[20] JONKKKK#4186
number out of 100, 1 is bright 2 is clef or whatever he was called

[20] Toaster#0403
OP pls nerf
so
low chance

[20] Toaster#0403
though if i made an scp game i TOTALLY would have a ton of like 1/10 to 1/500 chance things that just happen randomly

[20] JONKKKK#4186
that seems *kinda* cool

[20] Toaster#0403
so every game has some wacky new shit

[20] Toaster#0403
lost dataaaaaa

[20] Toaster#0403
hellppppp

[20] JONKKKK#4186
but the dr bright thing is too good of an idea to make that rare

[20] Toaster#0403
ah im back

[20] Toaster#0403
maybe okokok

[20] JONKKKK#4186
so are you on your way back?

[20] Toaster#0403
becoming dr bright is 1/50 (but you have to be a scientist first so still semi rare) but getting the inv full of micros is like 1/50 even after youve gotten bright.
so 1/50 and then ANOTHRR 1/50 to see if you get the micros
if no micros, its just a name change and maybe a slightly higher keycard as a small advantage

[20] Toaster#0403
also no

[20] Toaster#0403
tomorrow

[20] JONKKKK#4186
yeah i think it should just be no micro or maybe 1 micro

[20] Toaster#0403
ithink waisiaiwiaa

[20] Toaster#0403
wait

[20] Toaster#0403
hol yp

[20] JONKKKK#4186
and your goal is to get as many enemy kills as you can

[20] JONKKKK#4186
or something

[21] Toaster#0403
ok so i made a fake csgo crash thing, and the random number gen for that is like lower numbers are way more common (its rare to get a 3, you usually get 1-1.75) BUT every now and then you get a RIDICULOUSLY high number
that except it determins how many micros you start with
very VERY high = full inv
<10 = 3 or 4
<5 = 2
❤ = 1
<1.75 = 0

[21] Toaster#0403
oh shit < 3 autocorrects to heart lol

[21] JONKKKK#4186
n i c e

[21] Toaster#0403
maybe <2 = 1 and <1- idk its hard to think on vacation

[21] Toaster#0403
u get the idea thi

[21] Toaster#0403
tho

[21] Toaster#0403

[22] Toaster#0403
see

[22] Toaster#0403
but if nintendo just

[22] Toaster#0403
released their games for pc

[22] Toaster#0403
-more buyers

[22] Toaster#0403
-better graphics

[22] Toaster#0403
ez untapped market right there

[22] Speguni#3116
But I would prefer the console innovation honestly

[22] Toaster#0403
cuz theres obviously demand for it

[22] Speguni#3116
Nintendo lead to modern vr

[22] Toaster#0403
what?

[22] Toaster#0403
never heard that b4

[22] Toaster#0403
not saying its false just sayin w h a t ? ? ?

[22] Toaster#0403
explain pls

[22] Speguni#3116
Virtual boy and the Wii motion stuff

[22] Toaster#0403
oh yeah sure

[22] Toaster#0403
that sounded sarcastic

[22] Toaster#0403
i meant like

[22] Speguni#3116
Virtual boy was shit admittedly but it lead to innovation

[22] Toaster#0403
yeah youre right lol

[22] Speguni#3116
Na yeah it's cool I understood

[22] Toaster#0403
idk why but 'sure' always seems sarcastic to me over text

[22] Toaster#0403
its like

[22] Toaster#0403
an inherently sarcastic word

[22] Toaster#0403
idk

[22] Speguni#3116
Yeah

[22] Speguni#3116
I see what you mean

[22] Toaster#0403
you can make it obviously sarcastic with like

[22] Toaster#0403
suuuuuurree

[22] Toaster#0403
¯\_(ツ)_/¯

[22] Speguni#3116
Making things sound not sarcastic over text is a very real challenge

[22] Toaster#0403
yeah lol

[22] Speguni#3116
Even that sentence sounds sarcastic

[22] Toaster#0403
ok i should sleep cuz i need to get readjusted to the time zone instead of staying up till 12 every night

[22] Toaster#0403
hyped for you coming over here tho

[22] Speguni#3116
Yeah I can't wait

[22] Speguni#3116
Night

[16] Toaster#0403

[20] GoldenPot8o#2294
There are multiple dimensions of existence, like every universe has a ladder of advancement that gets progressively wackier, and the species that get trapped in-between the dimensions get all wacky and basically turn into other dimensions intersecting with our universe

[21] GoldenPot8o#2294
Fun fact the reason you can’t use a pencil eraser to tap your phone is because the phone senses temperature

[21] GoldenPot8o#2294
So you can tap your phone with a cold piece of metal

[21] GoldenPot8o#2294
Yeah

[21] GoldenPot8o#2294
I put my phone against my desk and because apple suggests words it typed that

[21] Toaster#0403

[21] JONKKKK#4186

This happens in many wonky scps

[21] JONKKKK#4186
does font-size 0 make it invisible?

[19] GoldenPot8o#2294
My phone is made by capitalists

[19] GoldenPot8o#2294
What are you confused about isa

[19] Serendipity#3758
I don't think that's how that works

[19] GoldenPot8o#2294
Researcher: but you’re re speaking to me
D-69420: just let me be dead in peace

[19] Serendipity#3758

[19] JONKKKK#4186
d-69420 lmao

[19] GoldenPot8o#2294
K so it’s a spooky thing that is whatever you expect it to be

[19] GoldenPot8o#2294
And the d-boi expected it to kill him

[19] JONKKKK#4186
no wouldnt you actually die tho?

[19] GoldenPot8o#2294
No no

[19] JONKKKK#4186
because if you expect to die then you do

[19] Toaster#0403
yeah you would

[19] Toaster#0403
you would die

[19] Toaster#0403
because your brain thinks its dead

[19] Toaster#0403
so it would just stop functioning

[19] Serendipity#3758
...

[19] Toaster#0403
any time you died to it youd just have a fucking stroke

[19] GoldenPot8o#2294
We decided that they just think they are dead

[19] JONKKKK#4186
whos we?

[19] GoldenPot8o#2294
This was decided

[19] JONKKKK#4186
us?

[19] GoldenPot8o#2294
Toaster and I

[19] Toaster#0403
lies

[19] JONKKKK#4186

[19] Serendipity#3758
Obviously I am not apart of said "we"

[19] GoldenPot8o#2294
Oh also toaster read the update to the E

[19] JONKKKK#4186

itd only be funny if we like actively did it

[20] GoldenPot8o#2294
Also @JONKKKK you want me to send the E scp to you?

[20] Toaster#0403
if we all made twitter accounts (i think i might already have one but id prolly remake it) and just the *only* thing we did on them is argue with each other using rare insults and retarded topics

[20] GoldenPot8o#2294
Or an arg would be cool

[20] Toaster#0403
yeah but ARG wouldnt be as funny

[20] JONKKKK#4186
and yeah sure nate

[20] GoldenPot8o#2294

[20] GoldenPot8o#2294
It’s on your school account

[20] Toaster#0403

[13] GoldenPot8o#2294
Fun fact, you don’t actually need to see the big screen for jackbox

[13] GoldenPot8o#2294
You could host a game and we could all play

[13] Toaster#0403
???

[13] GoldenPot8o#2294
It tells you what’s happening on the mobile screen

[13] Toaster#0403
really? wouldnt you not be able to see the stuff

[13] GoldenPot8o#2294
No no, it gives you all you need

[13] Toaster#0403
how

[13] GoldenPot8o#2294
the big screen is just a fancier version of the mobile screen

[13] Toaster#0403
what do you mean the mobile screen

[13] GoldenPot8o#2294
On the screen screen you play on it gives you your prompts, and what to answer, and all the answers

[13] Toaster#0403
didnt give me all the answers

[13] GoldenPot8o#2294
The only one it doesn’t give you is your own submission

[13] GoldenPot8o#2294
When you’re voting

[13] Toaster#0403
oh well when youre vOting

[13] Toaster#0403

[08] JONKKKK#4186
yeah ok

[08] Toaster#0403

[08] JONKKKK#4186
i mean like 2-5 are the same

[08] JONKKKK#4186
also 6+7

[08] Toaster#0403
its like

[08] Toaster#0403
1 is diff
2-3 very close
4-5 pretty much the same
6-7 very close

[08] Toaster#0403
in 2+3 and 6+7 you can still se s l i g h t shade differences

[08] Toaster#0403
bottom ones are darker

[08] Toaster#0403
but thats why the image is grouped the way it is cuz theyre very close

Is this a dnd boss intro

[21] Toaster#0403
*nate has joined the battle*

[21] GoldenPot8o#2294
Fuck

[21] GoldenPot8o#2294
Prepare for a bunch of bullying

[21] Toaster#0403
is that

[21] Toaster#0403
okay

[21] Toaster#0403
so

[21] Toaster#0403
you just had a very intense intro

[21] GoldenPot8o#2294
What

[21] Toaster#0403
with clouds

[21] Toaster#0403
and such

[21] Toaster#0403
and the first thing you say when the players notice you is

[21] Toaster#0403
"fuck"

[21] Toaster#0403
"prepare for a bunch of bullying"

[21] GoldenPot8o#2294
Oh I’m the boss?

[21] GoldenPot8o#2294
I thought I was a player

[21] Toaster#0403
>player explains to boss that theyre the boss

[21] Blanxy#6148
What is happening?

[21] Toaster#0403
>boss didnt know

[21] GoldenPot8o#2294
Fite me Liam

[21] Serendipity#3758
....I hope y'all realize that was just a random sentence I made up....

[21] Toaster#0403
no its Nates boss intro

[21] Toaster#0403
cant go back now

[21] Serendipity#3758
Okie dokie

[21] GoldenPot8o#2294
I’m a boss just because of the sheer ***__B I G  B R A I N__***

[21] Toaster#0403
its your one disadvantage tho

[21] Toaster#0403
it weighs you down

[21] GoldenPot8o#2294
Isa fite me

[21] GoldenPot8o#2294
Yeah lol

[21] Blanxy#6148
So

[21] Serendipity#3758
I will don't challenge me

[21] MEE6#4876
You talk too much, @Serendipity. You just advanced to level 6.

[21] Blanxy#6148
Nate’s a boss now?

[21] GoldenPot8o#2294
Intelligence 200
Speed 5

[21] Toaster#0403
we need to have a channel thats a DND campaign except everything you do in that channel you do as your character

[21] Toaster#0403
and also no deleting messages

[21] GoldenPot8o#2294
Dibs on dm

[21] Toaster#0403
nonononono

[21] Toaster#0403
dm is also player

[21] GoldenPot8o#2294
But that’s so hard

[21] Toaster#0403
you tell general story points but its made up as we go for the most part

[21] Toaster#0403
you dont have a thing thats like

[21] Toaster#0403
"oh hey there are monsters here on this part of the map"

[21] Toaster#0403
even time we change location

[21] Toaster#0403
a random player rolls a dice

[21] Toaster#0403
and depending on what they roll

[21] Toaster#0403
there are either monsters or no monsters

[21] Toaster#0403
*change my mind*

[21] GoldenPot8o#2294
That’s not how it works

[21] Toaster#0403
>walks into dungeon
>rolls nat 20
>clears dungeon with one dice roll

[21] GoldenPot8o#2294
🅱

[21] GoldenPot8o#2294
AC of 1 but I can dodge many attacks

[21] Toaster#0403
doing a dnd campaign in discord wouldnt be hard

[21] Toaster#0403
like at all

[21] GoldenPot8o#2294
We should make a new server for it tho

[21] GoldenPot8o#2294
I don’t think just anyone can join

[21] Toaster#0403
what do you meaaannn

[21] Toaster#0403
just inside a random dungeon in the middle of an intense battle

[21] Toaster#0403
and some rando joins just like "hey guys"

[21] Toaster#0403
"hey guys its scarce here"

[21] GoldenPot8o#2294
Xavier, Nikolai, random

[21] Toaster#0403
i could make a bot that keeps track of player stats

[21] Toaster#0403
character sheets but

[21] Toaster#0403
d i s c o r d b o t

[21] GoldenPot8o#2294
I could just rollout character sheets to everyone

[21] GoldenPot8o#2294
Cause commanding the bot to open the sheet every turn would be annoying

[21] Serendipity#3758
I love how I barely even get whats happening and it's great

[21] Toaster#0403
it could just DM you a sheet and then edit the message as it updates

[21] GoldenPot8o#2294
Isa you would actually have a bunch of fun with dnd

[21] Toaster#0403
but thatd be sorta hard

[21] GoldenPot8o#2294
You should join my campaign

[21] Toaster#0403
me or isa

[21] GoldenPot8o#2294
Isa

[21] GoldenPot8o#2294
You’re in my campaign

[21] Serendipity#3758
I'd be a lost dog

[21] Toaster#0403
ohh oh yeah

[21] Toaster#0403
thuoght you meant gay dnd club campaign for some reason

[21] GoldenPot8o#2294
It’s ok so is everyone else

[21] GoldenPot8o#2294
Nono

[21] Serendipity#3758
This is quite a tempting offer, what are the qualifications

[21] GoldenPot8o#2294
Also we need to continue the campaign at some point now that I know what I’m doing

[21] GoldenPot8o#2294
Qualifications: literally just have a school computer and be able to come to the teen center sometimes

[21] Toaster#0403
Questions: why do we need a school computer

[21] Serendipity#3758
How often is sometimes?

[21] Toaster#0403
like never

[21] GoldenPot8o#2294
Makes it way easier to have stuff digitalization

[21] Serendipity#3758
Would I get yelled at for not understand anything

[21] GoldenPot8o#2294
Are you full time living on my street? Cause I’m riding the bus to the teen center on Friday

[21] GoldenPot8o#2294
You could come with and I could help you make a character

[21] Toaster#0403
ill probably go to TC on friday

[21] Serendipity#3758
What time Friday

[21] Serendipity#3758
I'm living on your street half to three fourths of the time..my parents be are divorced

[21] GoldenPot8o#2294
Don’t know yet I’ll let you know when o figure out the bus schedule

[21] GoldenPot8o#2294
Ok

[21] Serendipity#3758
Yep

[21] JONKKKK#4186
oof divorced parents seem suck

[21] GoldenPot8o#2294
I didn’t know how things got smoothed out

[21] Serendipity#3758
@JONKKKK I'm used to it

[21] GoldenPot8o#2294
I also have better ideas now so I could restart the campaign

[21] GoldenPot8o#2294
And I’m like aware what’s happening

[21] Toaster#0403
aw man

[21] Serendipity#3758
@GoldenPot8o why not, I guess I'll join

[21] Toaster#0403
we should keep it going but sorta just ignore what weve done so far

[21] Toaster#0403
like

[21] Toaster#0403
i want to keep my building

[21] JONKKKK#4186
i agree

[21] JONKKKK#4186
we should just keep going cuz we were like 0% in

[21] GoldenPot8o#2294
I could keep going but you might have to make your character sheets better lol

[21] JONKKKK#4186
ye lol

[21] GoldenPot8o#2294
And I might make role playing and stuff better

[21] GoldenPot8o#2294
Now that I understand what a good campaign looks like

[21] JONKKKK#4186
i still think we should do a discord dnd improv thing

[21] JONKKKK#4186
because going to the teen center isn't really consistent

[21] GoldenPot8o#2294
Separate campaign tho

[21] JONKKKK#4186
because discord calling is a lot easier then going to the tc

[21] JONKKKK#4186
ye ye seperate campaign

[21] Toaster#0403
fuck im blanking on names of stuff

[21] Toaster#0403
if my strength is 15 but then i get +2

[21] Toaster#0403
whats the 15 called and whats the +2

[21] Toaster#0403
proficiency?

[21] JONKKKK#4186
i thiiiiink?

[21] Toaster#0403
bonus?

[21] GoldenPot8o#2294
The 15 is your score, +2 is your modifier

[21] Toaster#0403
thx bb

[21] GoldenPot8o#2294
:CattoBlush:

[21] Toaster#0403
fucking hell lmao

[21] GoldenPot8o#2294
What

[21] Toaster#0403
i forgot that i put my only flaw as being friends with jonathan

[21] GoldenPot8o#2294
Oof

[21] JONKKKK#4186
:(

[21] Toaster#0403
also i still have 2 pebbles in my inventory

[21] GoldenPot8o#2294
Yeah I might be more strict on role playing stuff

[21] GoldenPot8o#2294
Cause it really does make the game more fun

[21] Toaster#0403
wdym this game is already great

[21] GoldenPot8o#2294
That’s my point

[21] GoldenPot8o#2294
Because if you rp good then there are things that happen like this
*party is getting nowhere talking to a voice behind the door*
Me: listen asshole, we’re gonna go beat the shit out of ral (the bad guy) cause he’s part of the plan for the world to end
Voice: yeah u right lol

[21] Toaster#0403
what

[21] Toaster#0403
@GoldenPot8o how much are pebbles worth in GP

[21] GoldenPot8o#2294
0.1 cp

[21] GoldenPot8o#2294
So every 10000 pebbles is one gold

[21] Toaster#0403
*in GP*

[21] Toaster#0403
0.001?

[21] Toaster#0403
or 0.00001

[21] GoldenPot8o#2294
0.00001

[22] Toaster#0403
do you remember what "gold orb sky code" was

[22] Toaster#0403
apparently i have one in my inventory

[22] GoldenPot8o#2294
Sky or spy

[22] Toaster#0403
sky

[22] GoldenPot8o#2294
OH it’s the gold orb that you were supposed to put in the statues hand

[22] GoldenPot8o#2294
But you did a jonathan

[22] GoldenPot8o#2294
And yoinked all the loot

[22] Toaster#0403
ohhh okay

[22] Toaster#0403
how much is it worth

[22] Toaster#0403
yknow what we should do to keep track of everything

[22] Toaster#0403
put it in a spreadsheet

[22] Toaster#0403
like

[22] GoldenPot8o#2294
die 20

[22] GoldenPot8o#2294
Fok

[22] Toaster#0403
just a spreadsheet that lists every item weve come across and the price per one

[22] Toaster#0403
also 1d20?

[22] Toaster#0403
thats the price?

[22] Toaster#0403
thats not that much for a solid gold orb lol

[22] GoldenPot8o#2294
No no

[22] GoldenPot8o#2294
Just roll

[22] Toaster#0403

[22] GoldenPot8o#2294
Are you selling it?

[22] GoldenPot8o#2294
I mean

[22] Toaster#0403
no i just like having prices for stuff in my inv instead of "N/A"

[22] GoldenPot8o#2294
I guess your motivation is money

[22] GoldenPot8o#2294
You’re basically heros for hire

[22] Toaster#0403
also how much is my store worth

[22] GoldenPot8o#2294
10,000 for the store, 2000 for the orb to any normal seller, more if you sell it to the right person

[22] GoldenPot8o#2294
Also you could use the store to sell adventuring services and the items you find lol

[22] Toaster#0403
okay

[22] Toaster#0403
prices for all N/A pls
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/539106814697013250/568286587696447488/unknown.png

[22] GoldenPot8o#2294
Imma say that you can’t sell gear

[22] Toaster#0403
aw whattt

[22] GoldenPot8o#2294
So I’m

[22] Toaster#0403
what about bricks

[22] Toaster#0403
bricks are like tons of tiny pebbles squished together

[22] Toaster#0403
so like at least 0.001 gp

[22] Toaster#0403
pls

[22] GoldenPot8o#2294
But it’s like enter the gungeon *** infinite weapons ***

[22] GoldenPot8o#2294
Um 1 sp you do the conversion

[22] Toaster#0403
0.0001

[22] Toaster#0403
thats what im taking it as

[22] Toaster#0403
thx

[22] GoldenPot8o#2294
What I was giving you was worth more but ok

[22] Toaster#0403
well idfk the conversion and im too lazy to figure it out so im taking the lower price

[22] GoldenPot8o#2294
You can just google it

[22] GoldenPot8o#2294
Hey what if I just um

[22] GoldenPot8o#2294
*announcment* everyone in my irl campaign is now level 5

[22] Toaster#0403

https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/539106814697013250/568289845420752907/unknown.png

[22] Toaster#0403
think i got everything

[22] Toaster#0403
oh heck wait

[22] Toaster#0403
fUCK WHERE DO I PUT THIS

[22] GoldenPot8o#2294
Um fun fact

[22] GoldenPot8o#2294
The character sheet that I can send you on the school computers can do all the calculations for you

[22] Toaster#0403
for gp and stuff?

[22] Toaster#0403
what else is there calculations for lol

[22] GoldenPot8o#2294
I mean skills and modifiers, AC, DC, hit die

[22] GoldenPot8o#2294
Everything that involves math

[22] Toaster#0403
nothing really involves math tho?

[22] Toaster#0403
like

[22] GoldenPot8o#2294
Except yeah it does

[22] Toaster#0403
what do you mean

[22] Toaster#0403
"skills and modifiers" oh okay so it can do 15+2 for me
"AC" dont even remember what that means
"DC" same with this one lol
"hit cease the reproduction process of cells" what are you talking about

[22] GoldenPot8o#2294
There are literally proportionality calculations to determine modifiers and proficiency bonuses

[22] Toaster#0403
what

[22] Toaster#0403
you mean

[22] Toaster#0403
whatever i rolled

[22] Toaster#0403
plus 2

[22] Toaster#0403
or whatever my modifier is

[22] Toaster#0403
such a hard calculation

[22] GoldenPot8o#2294
AC= how hard it is to hit you
DC= how hard it is for you to hit and do things
Hit die=what you roll to see if you hit the thing
And no, your modifier is +2 because your score is 15 not the other way around

[22] Toaster#0403
oh yeaah forgot that thats how you calculated that stuff

[22] Toaster#0403
but again

[22] Toaster#0403
its not like thats hard

[22] Toaster#0403
idk them exactly but its just

[22] Toaster#0403
if its less than this then its this

[22] Toaster#0403
thats not really proportionality

[22] GoldenPot8o#2294
You better shut up before I go full dark souls on your ass

[22] Toaster#0403
oh wait ur on ur phone u have bad

[22] Toaster#0403
was gonna say send me the one youre talking about

[22] Toaster#0403
so i could verify my memory of it looking <good

[22] GoldenPot8o#2294
Alright

[22] Toaster#0403
except prolly not

[22] GoldenPot8o#2294
And a demon who lives in a volcano

[22] Toaster#0403

[22] Toaster#0403
also

[22] Toaster#0403
"i pursuade them to not fight us"

[22] Toaster#0403

oh god i just got a terrible idea

[22] GoldenPot8o#2294
Also I have a 🅱izza account with monis so I can 🅱izza on Friday

[22] Toaster#0403
discord plugin that looks for every time you say “your” “youre” “ur” etc. and replaces it with the wrong one

[22] Toaster#0403
same with their theyre there

[22] Toaster#0403
oh yeah i was also gonna make a website that uses socketio to talk to a discord bot that lets you do dnd functions (roll each kind of dice and stuff) and then itll say like “Jonathan rolled a d20 and got a 12” in a specific channel in discord

[22] Toaster#0403
could also keep track of health and stuff like that but thatd be more complicated

[22] Toaster#0403
why is coding stuff complicated

okay im sorry fellow gamers but discord dark mode isnt super good and there arent really any non-broken good ones on betterdiscord so im using a betterdiscord light theme because it looks fuccin sweet 🅱

[20] Toaster#0403
oh but im still technically in dark mode

[20] Toaster#0403
and in light mode it looks terrible and broken

[20] Toaster#0403
so

[20] Toaster#0403

[21] JONKKKK#4186
EW

[21] Toaster#0403
a screenshot of the theme youre using looks very weird inside of the theme youre using

[21] GoldenPot8o#2294
Looks like engineering paper

[21] Toaster#0403
yh

[21] Toaster#0403
its cool

[21] JONKKKK#4186
but

[21] GoldenPot8o#2294

[21] JONKKKK#4186
and like

[21] Serendipity#3758

[21] JONKKKK#4186
why does it have lines in the background?

[21] Toaster#0403
because it l o o k s g o o d

[21] Toaster#0403
c r a z y

[21] JONKKKK#4186
and i can barely read anything!

[21] GoldenPot8o#2294
I’m not dumb I saw it Isa

[21] JONKKKK#4186
that looks big bad

[21] Toaster#0403
i do wish it had less vignette

[21] Toaster#0403
also jok ur opinion is invalid

[21] JONKKKK#4186
all im saying is that i def wouldnt use it

[21] GoldenPot8o#2294
Vinegar

[21] Serendipity#3758
I never implied that you are a dumb, nate

[21] JONKKKK#4186
you can use it

[21] GoldenPot8o#2294
Well i saw you say my name

[21] JONKKKK#4186
(as long as you sign this giant document, in which it definitely doesnt say your mom is gay)

[21] Serendipity#3758
why does your name

[21] Toaster#0403
it was in suggestions

[21] Toaster#0403
but it wasnt a suggestion

[21] Toaster#0403
so

[21] Toaster#0403
i delet

[21] Serendipity#3758
Yeah no duh I'm just being a dumb

[21] GoldenPot8o#2294
Why does my name?

[21] Serendipity#3758
Yes

[21] GoldenPot8o#2294
Because I’m god

[21] Serendipity#3758
No

[21] Serendipity#3758

[21] JONKKKK#4186

[21] Serendipity#3758

[21] GoldenPot8o#2294

[21] Serendipity#3758
According to Google

[21] GoldenPot8o#2294
Jonk what?

[21] Toaster#0403
yeah what

[21] GoldenPot8o#2294
Oh no not a b-

[21] JONKKKK#4186
nates a student at god school and this is a project hes doing

[21] Serendipity#3758
Makes sense

[21] JONKKKK#4186
and so far its looking like a b- grade

[21] JONKKKK#4186
(nah jklol)

[21] Serendipity#3758
No more like a c+

[21] GoldenPot8o#2294
It’s not my fault that the simulator simulates idiots

[21] Toaster#0403
mAN i REALLY WISH 90% OF BD THEMES WERENT *fUCKING ANIME*

[21] Toaster#0403
i have found sO man themes that look pretty good but then wHOOPS THE BACKGROUND IMAGE IS AN ANIME

[21] Toaster#0403
BACKGROUND IMAGE =/= GOOD UNLESS ITS SIMPLISTIC

[21] JONKKKK#4186
yeah see why is the default theme so bad?

[21] JONKKKK#4186
like

[21] GoldenPot8o#2294
Are the other 10 less censored anime?

[21] JONKKKK#4186
okok that doesnt make sense

[21] Toaster#0403
what

[21] JONKKKK#4186
lemme restart

[21] JONKKKK#4186
like yeah, see? why are you looking for more themes? is there a reason you don't like the default one or do you just want something different?

[21] Toaster#0403
default one is boring

[21] Toaster#0403
and the one i normally use

[21] Toaster#0403
-i have also gotten slightly bored of

[21] Toaster#0403
-was broken for some reason

[21] JONKKKK#4186
klol

[21] JONKKKK#4186
ids how the default one is boring tho

[21] JONKKKK#4186
i mean

[21] JONKKKK#4186
i guess its *simple* if thats what you mean

[21] Toaster#0403
its not very interesting

[21] Toaster#0403
its like

[21] Toaster#0403
too complex to be minimalist or modern

[21] Toaster#0403
but also not complex enough to be super good looking

[21] Toaster#0403
the one i just showed u (the light theme) is complex in a good way (though as i said i wish there wasnt vignette)

[21] Toaster#0403
and the one I used to use

[21] JONKKKK#4186
yeah the thing with your theme is that
-the colors match up poorly and that + the fact that almost all text is a brightish red makes it hard to read
-it looks a bit busy for my taste

but im not saying that you shouldn't use it or anything, just saying its not to my taste

[21] Toaster#0403
it simplistic and minimalist

[21] JONKKKK#4186
the one you used to use?

[21] Toaster#0403
also I can make the text not red

[21] Toaster#0403
i just did lol

[21] Serendipity#3758
Night yalls

[21] JONKKKK#4186
nite

[21] Toaster#0403
the GREEN text is what looked real bad

[21] Toaster#0403
literally could barely read it lol

[21] JONKKKK#4186
oo o o f

[21] JONKKKK#4186
but yeah i think the current discord theme is fine

[21] JONKKKK#4186
like

[21] Toaster#0403
its lame xd

[21] JONKKKK#4186
it conveys just enough information at a glance

[21] Toaster#0403
what

[21] JONKKKK#4186
the theme

[21] Toaster#0403
no theme conveys less or more information than the normal one

[21] Toaster#0403
themes dont change content

[21] JONKKKK#4186
(well wait yeah hang on)

[21] Toaster#0403
mk lol

[21] JONKKKK#4186
i have kinda dumb

[21] JONKKKK#4186
but yeah i mean

[22] JONKKKK#4186
okok what i think might look nice is like the normal discord theme but with the lines that yours has in a dark grey, a bit darker than the normal bg

[22] GoldenPot8o#2294
“I’m not gonna lie I’m a little retarded”

[22] JONKKKK#4186
me_irl

[22] Toaster#0403
nah other way around jok

[22] Toaster#0403
lines should be lighter than bg

[22] JONKKKK#4186
ye

[22] JONKKKK#4186
oh

[22] JONKKKK#4186
eh

[22] Toaster#0403
im not gonna lie im a little retarded

[22] JONKKKK#4186
lol

[22] JONKKKK#4186
i think it would clash a *bit* with the text

[22] Toaster#0403
time to mess with css

[22] Toaster#0403
oh fuck maybe not pls

[22] Toaster#0403
200+ lines of css thats a no thanks

[22] JONKKKK#4186
like this would look kinda neat (ignore crappiness)

[22] JONKKKK#4186

[22] JONKKKK#4186
well

[22] JONKKKK#4186
i mean i couldnt really do anything better

[22] Toaster#0403

[22] Toaster#0403
i could probably make this not light mode

[22] JONKKKK#4186

[22] JONKKKK#4186
like

[22] JONKKKK#4186
ok what did you even do

[22] JONKKKK#4186

[22] JONKKKK#4186
Not saying it's 100% interesting just wanna remember it

[22] Toaster#0403

you actually cannot make me fucking believe you mistyped "steam" as "treem" and "spore" as "trore"

[19] GoldenPot8o#2294
and yet i did

[19] Toaster#0403
maybe just fucking dont

[19] Toaster#0403
its annoying as hell and its actually harder to mess that up than get it right

[19] JONKKKK#4186
i mean why is it that bad?

[19] Toaster#0403
also pretty hard to "accidentally" make both "typos" start with the same letters?

that it happened

[19] Toaster#0403
never noticed

[19] JONKKKK#4186
like

[19] Toaster#0403
also that still doesnt explain the 391 views thing unless it was like a massively popular video but you didnt provide context so it just makes no sense

[19] Toaster#0403
301

[19] JONKKKK#4186
that was up to 2015

[19] JONKKKK#4186
301 views

[19] JONKKKK#4186
on just a random video

[19] Toaster#0403
because in order for it to be a joke itd have to be a popular vid

[19] JONKKKK#4186
idk

[19] JONKKKK#4186
i just thought it was funny

[19] Toaster#0403
but since its just nondescript 301 views it xould be literally any vid

[19] Toaster#0403

[15] JONKKKK#4186

[15] Toaster#0403
dud cannabis is like

[15] Toaster#0403
the least bad of all drug

[15] Toaster#0403
literally not as bad as smoking or vaping

[15] JONKKKK#4186
(but still p bad because drug bad)

[15] Toaster#0403
idk man

[15] Toaster#0403
marijuana safest drug

[15] Toaster#0403
change my mind

[15] JONKKKK#4186
caffeine

[15] Toaster#0403
ok caffeine doesnt count unless ur like fuccin snorting pure caffiene powder

[15] JONKKKK#4186
yeah see

[15] JONKKKK#4186
its a drug

[15] JONKKKK#4186
BUT

[15] Toaster#0403
also marijuana might be less addictive then caffiene

[15] Toaster#0403
so

[15] Toaster#0403
¯\_(ツ)_/¯

[15] JONKKKK#4186
it's so safe that ppl are fine with it

[15] JONKKKK#4186
and yeah it kinda is

[15] Toaster#0403
what

[15] JONKKKK#4186
(more addictive than w e e d)

[15] Toaster#0403
yeah i said *might*

[15] Toaster#0403
and then just gogled it

[15] Toaster#0403
i was incorrect

[15] JONKKKK#4186
how addictive *is* it anyway?

[15] Toaster#0403
other than caffiene bcuz thats such a like widely used safe one

[15] Toaster#0403
marijuana?

[15] JONKKKK#4186
ye

[15] Toaster#0403
9% of all users are physically addicted

[15] Toaster#0403
basically v e r y s m o l

[15] JONKKKK#4186
vs caffine?

[15] JONKKKK#4186
because a LOT of ppl are addicted to caffine

[15] JONKKKK#4186
how is it 'not addictive'

[15] Toaster#0403

[15] JONKKKK#4186
yeah

[15] JONKKKK#4186

[15] JONKKKK#4186
"don't talk to me until i've had my coffee"

[15] JONKKKK#4186
is just

[15] Toaster#0403
ok so like

[15] Toaster#0403
50% addiction rate

[15] Toaster#0403
about

[15] Toaster#0403
is what im getting

[15] JONKKKK#4186
"without caffine i can't function as a human being"

[15] Toaster#0403
9% < 50%

[15] JONKKKK#4186
but yeah caffine is dumb

[15] Toaster#0403
so i was r i g h t haha

[15] JONKKKK#4186
like it doesn't even substitute for sleep

[15] Toaster#0403
ok the point im trying to make is not caffiene bad i think we already knew that

[15] JONKKKK#4186
drinking coffee to make up for lost sleep is like taking pain medicine for a broken leg

[15] Toaster#0403
my point is marijuana good

[15] Toaster#0403
or at least better

[15] JONKKKK#4186
well

[10] Speguni#3116
Boy you already know that's why DC is better

[10] Toaster#0403

[15] Toaster#0403
ok idk why i find this so funny and you guys probably wont find it funny but im recording voice lines for drivers ed project and every time i mess up i listen back on it and i just get the most *passive agressive fucking voice on the planet*

[15] Toaster#0403
like i soudn so goddamn annoyed and its hilarious

[15] Toaster#0403
oKAY NEW FUN GAME

[15] Toaster#0403
take every time i mess up a line and line them up so you just here like 4 of me talking and then they gradually fall out with something like "oh my god.."

[16] GoldenPot8o#2294
Yeah see if I perfected it fully I’d sell it not get high off it

[16] GoldenPot8o#2294
Science is the way to money

[16] GoldenPot8o#2294
But yeah brownies I would totally do

[16] Toaster#0403
u mean perfected as in perfect dosage not highest dosage yes

[16] Toaster#0403
also yeah weed brownee or cookee best way to drug

[16] GoldenPot8o#2294
See if you get it right you could actually make a batter as opposed to a dough

[16] Toaster#0403
what

[16] JONKKKK#4186
w e e d  c a k e

[16] GoldenPot8o#2294
Weed brownies in their unbaked form is a dough

[16] GoldenPot8o#2294
Not a batter like normal brownies

[16] Toaster#0403
only real reason to use math in real life: finding out how much marijuana to put in your weed brownies

[16] Toaster#0403
also nate no?

[16] Toaster#0403
you just use like brownie mix or something but instead of using vegetable oil with the brownie mix use cannabis oil

[16] GoldenPot8o#2294
Isaiah told me that and he’s a drug head so

[16] Toaster#0403
well first of all why are you listening to isaiah

[16] Toaster#0403
also you could still be right my way is only one way to do it lol

[16] GoldenPot8o#2294
Yeah

[16] GoldenPot8o#2294
The reason why it goes in brownies is because in brownies the taster of chocolate is strong, weed tastes like absolute shot

[16] GoldenPot8o#2294
Also yeah I did try to tell him that if you did it right then you could have a batter

[16] Toaster#0403
yeah

[16] Toaster#0403
but i mean

[16] Toaster#0403
as mentioned in the video im making xd you can put it in tons of stuff

[16] Toaster#0403

[16] Toaster#0403

What the fuck did you just fucking say to me you little bitch? I’ll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals; and I’ve been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda; and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I’m the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You’re fucking dead kid. I can be anywhere anytime; and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways and that’s just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little “clever” comment was about to bring down upon you maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn’t; you didn’t; and now you’re paying the price you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You’re fucking dead kiddo.

nope. but to be a part of ltjn you have to be an epic gamer

[21] Shrooms#5080

[21] JONKKKK#4186
because some people are epic gamers and not in ltjn, theres just no non-epic gamers in ltjn

[21] Shrooms#5080

[15] Toaster#0403
its students complaining about LAHS

[15] Toaster#0403

[15] Toaster#0403
ok some criticisms of this

[15] GoldenPot8o#2294
It’s not mine btw

[15] Toaster#0403
some parts sound almost like just a failing student thats like "oh you guys pay more attention to A students or ppl with better grades than me so im gonna write up a whole 95 things that are complaints of the school"

[15] Silicon#2310
no

[15] Toaster#0403
like some parts just paint A students in a bad light

[15] Toaster#0403
and thats dumb

[15] Silicon#2310
die

[15] Toaster#0403
ok

[15] Toaster#0403
and some parts sound e x t r e m e l y pretentious

[15] Toaster#0403
they coulda said some things nicer/better

[15] GoldenPot8o#2294
One thing I find is that they pay too much attention to the good students

[15] Toaster#0403
well yeah sure thats valid

[15] Toaster#0403
but they way they worded some stuff just soudns like "REE I DONT HAVE GOOD GRADES AND HE DOES SO BASICALLY HES BAD"

[15] Toaster#0403
the point theyre trying to make is valid but they way they make it is sorta iffy

[15] Alterae#0258
For 77/78, anyone who sends a sick student to school is a threat to public health and should be treated as such.
Toaster makes some valid points.
The document makes a lot of valid points.

Also if a teacher pays attention to a better student it’s probably because the bad student is well, bad. I mean they actually would do their job for students that want their help not students that think that the teacher will just help them because they have a bad grade

[17] Toaster#0403

[21] Toaster#0403
thanks walter

[23] GoldenPot8o#2294
Ok so on the last page

[23] GoldenPot8o#2294
I would say that the school doesn’t just suck at solving mental health issues, LAPS as a whole has an issue where they try to solve the symptoms not the underlying problem, this goes for literally every problem they try to fix

[23] Vlalkosei#3238
still speaking about the 95-theses

[23] GoldenPot8o#2294
Yes

[23] Vlalkosei#3238
because most of it actually sounds like a persons friend group is all of the sources

[23] GoldenPot8o#2294
Yeah I picked up on that too

[23] GoldenPot8o#2294
The argument is very focused on 2 things, (1 if you think about it) homework and mental health.

[23] Vlalkosei#3238
plus the fact that the person who wrote the paper doesn't acknowledge the fact that mental illnesses can actually be genetic and are not just caused by school i mean it can actually happen but its not that common that it should be a main concern to a HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT

[23] Vlalkosei#3238
stress is not a mental illness i would also like to point out

[23] GoldenPot8o#2294
I do agree with their points about Saturday school and such, if you check into Saturday school you aren’t allowed to leave until 3

[23] GoldenPot8o#2294
Which is bull

[23] GoldenPot8o#2294
What if they only have like one thing to do

[23] Vlalkosei#3238
yes it really is
also the mental health thing is not just in LAHS it is actually in many schools, some students that have dyslexia, ADHD, etc might not get diagnosed until they are in their senior year of high school, plus even then some don't get diagnosed until even later, as an example my mom's co-worker's son has ADHD and didn't get diagnosed until this year and has had trouble with studding and other stuff like that, and to top it all off he wasn't even diagnosed by the school, but by a doctor so it is just something that people might not be able to find out till later in their lives
ok now i'm done

[23] GoldenPot8o#2294
You missed my point

[23] Vlalkosei#3238
one more thing the last one isnt even a complaint it is more of a blackmail if you ask me

[23] Vlalkosei#3238
but what was your point

[23] GoldenPot8o#2294
We are trying to steer away from just mental health, the issue is that LAPS sucks at solving any kind of issue, they dish out painkillers and bandaids when you get shot, but don’t fix the issue, just the problems that arise from it.

[23] Vlalkosei#3238
what the hell

[23] Vlalkosei#3238
when ever go down there they chuck an ice pack at me

[23] Vlalkosei#3238
(it causes more pain for me)

[23] GoldenPot8o#2294
Still missing the point, imagine if you had a leak in your cars gas tank, well the way that the school would fix that is to just keep adding gas so that you have enough

[23] GoldenPot8o#2294
They don’t patch the hole, they just add more and more gas, all the while the hole gets bigger

[23] Vlalkosei#3238
dude i saw what you were saying i just was like yess i can make a joke about spraining my wrist and them toughing an ice pack at me

[23] GoldenPot8o#2294
Oh

[23] GoldenPot8o#2294
It didn’t come across that way

[23] Vlalkosei#3238
this is a text chat do you know how hard it is to convey sarcasm like this

[23] GoldenPot8o#2294
Yeah

[23] MEE6#4876
You talk too much, @Vlalkosei. You just advanced to level 4.

[23] Vlalkosei#3238
i was mainly saying that the person is making valid points but only on stuff that is valid to them not to everyone else and either way it seems like they are also the kind of person to blame the school for everything i mean if we go back to the attention thing the student is complaining about not being able to get all the attention from the teacher, so it sounds like they are just expecting the teacher to come to them rather than the student go to the teacher (like normal people who want help) but rather the teacher is psychically attuned to the person and only that person so they always know when they need help

Get

[23] GoldenPot8o#2294
Yes they are malinformed, this is why if wish I knew who they were, so I could help them refine their argument

[23] Vlalkosei#3238
that would be good, also get better sources than the friend group

[13] Toaster#0403

[13] Toaster#0403

[13] JONKKKK#4186
im sticking with vivaldi because i like it

[13] Zildin#0532
vivaldi?

[13] Toaster#0403
vivaldi more like doesnt encrypt everything u do and also pay you for browsing the internet

[13] JONKKKK#4186
its a browser that i use and you can customize basically anything

[13] JONKKKK#4186
and its great

[13] Toaster#0403
vivaldi more like doesnt encrypt everything u do and also pay you for browsing the internet

[13] Alterae#0258
Vivaldi be weird.
I use Opera for the popout video player.

[13] Toaster#0403
i mean you can customize pretty much anything about chrome or brave too

[13] Toaster#0403
extensions/themes exist

[13] JONKKKK#4186
isnt oprera older than you?

[13] Toaster#0403
yes

[13] Toaster#0403
ok gtg for real now

[13] Toaster#0403
basically b r a v e g o o d

[13] JONKKKK#4186

[13] Alterae#0258
@JONKKKK maybe, so?

[13] Silicon#2310
i will slam you against a table

[13] JONKKKK#4186
yeah what he said

[13] Alterae#0258
Why?

[13] JONKKKK#4186
nah jk

[13] Alterae#0258
Also what about Opera being old?

[13] JONKKKK#4186
but i mean it seems like it would be slow

[13] Alterae#0258
Nah.

[13] JONKKKK#4186
unless they're still updating it

[13] Alterae#0258
OOF COURSE THEY ARE

[13] Alterae#0258
Why would they not be?

[13] JONKKKK#4186
because old things tend to not be updated

[13] JONKKKK#4186
but you proved me wrong so ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

[13] Alterae#0258
Like chrome or Firefox, Opera is an old, respected browser.

[13] Alterae#0258
They stay that way by being updated regularly.

[13] JONKKKK#4186
i was thinking that it would be old and outdated but if they're still updating it but i guess thats not the case

[13] Zildin#0532
quick someone recommend a good browser

[13] Alterae#0258
Opera

[13] MEE6#4876
You talk too much, @Alterae. You just advanced to level 7.

[13] Alterae#0258
Or firefox

[13] Alterae#0258
Or maybe brave?

[13] Silicon#2310
i will slam you against a table

[13] Alterae#0258
Or do Microsoft a favor and test out Edge Beta, based on Chromium.

[13] JONKKKK#4186
vivaldi is nice if you wanna be weird

[13] Alterae#0258
Basically any browser but IE or Chrome.

[13] Zildin#0532
IE?

[13] JONKKKK#4186
internet explorer

[13] Alterae#0258
Internut Exploder

[10] JONKKKK#4186
i mean minecarts use less iron...

[10] Toaster#0403
but he still had to make the rails

[10] Toaster#0403
which requires guld

[10] Toaster#0403
and ALSO iron

[10] Toaster#0403
instead of just wood

[10] Toaster#0403
hopper > cart

[10] HollowRisk#0001

[20] Serendipity#3758
Wat

[20] HollowRisk#0001
My son (14) watches a lot of video game streamers on Twitch.tv. I personally don't find them entertaining but I can understand why some people (like my son) do. Over the past month he's starting using terms like "pog", "jabaited", and "Kappa" which I guess are terms that are used in the scope of Twitch.

I don't have an issue with my son using these terms but it's gotten to the point where every sentence is Twitchspeak. We were having dinner and my daughter (age 12) was talking about how she got accepted for a summer program with the local animal shelter, and my son said "Pog you, easy clap". I told him that it was getting out of hand and that he would have to communicate normally to his parents and family. To that he said "Weird champ, feels weird man, normies omega LOL." Until he learns to communicate like a normal human being I've blacklisted Twitch from the internet for the time being. He's hysterical now but I told him that I would unblacklist it if he stopped using twitchspeak, but he's refusing to stop so for now it's banned.

that was a no u

[12] Toaster#0403
so

[12] Toaster#0403
youre wrong basically

[12] Alterae#0258
BUt I didn't say no u.

[12] Toaster#0403
you did

[12] Toaster#0403
just in a different form

[12] Toaster#0403
still counts

[12] Alterae#0258
depends on what you define as a no u.
I never specifically said "no u".
So I can win this debate if we get lawyery.

[13] Toaster#0403
no

hEY FELLOW GAMERS

[11] Toaster#0403
@EPIC GAMERS @COOL KIDS @BIG BEOBLE AND WHOEVER ELSE

[11] JONKKKK#4186
d

[11] Toaster#0403
we shold all minecraft

[11] Toaster#0403
smp fun

[11] Toaster#0403
we need l o t s o f ppl pls

[11] JONKKKK#4186
why lol

[11] Toaster#0403
because more ppl = more fun

[11] Toaster#0403
thats how mafia works

[11] JONKKKK#4186
why do you wanna do this so much all of a sudden?

[11] GoldenPot8o#2294
God I hate humidity

[11] Toaster#0403
cuz ive been binging callmecarsonlive videos

[11] Toaster#0403
also yes nate correct humidity bad

[11] GoldenPot8o#2294
Also yeah didn’t you say mc wasn’t fun

[11] Toaster#0403
unless its cold

[11] JONKKKK#4186
yeah you dont even like mc

[11] Toaster#0403
living in VA hurt my soul

[11] GoldenPot8o#2294
And also you said that after I posted a video of the same caliber

[11] Toaster#0403
MC gets boring if its just everyone doing their own thing and just not interacting but if u got like at *least* 5 ppl on a server who consistently play and have an actual community like carsons server does where theyre all like messing with each other and they have a goddamn pretend police force and stuff then its very very entertaining

[11] Silicon#2310
pee pee brain

[11] Silicon#2310
*wrong* thot

[11] Toaster#0403
shutup walter ur mom is a mom

[11] Toaster#0403
carsons server is like ideal bcuz its a lot of ppl who all know each other

[11] Silicon#2310
*wrong* thot

[11] Toaster#0403
for the most part at least

[11] Toaster#0403
what is that even responding to

[11] Toaster#0403
ohhhh

[11] Toaster#0403
know

[11] JONKKKK#4186
and also you wouldnt even keep it up

[11] Toaster#0403
WDYM

[11] JONKKKK#4186
the server

[11] Toaster#0403
i kept that server up 24/7 for an entire week but you nerds just stopped existing on it

[11] Toaster#0403
the only reason its not up right now is because i restarted my comp and forgot to turn it back on

[11] Toaster#0403
because you guys arent playing on it and asking me to

[11] JONKKKK#4186
i also think terraria could be fun with like 5 ppl

[11] JONKKKK#4186
but terraria servers are kinda hard

[11] Toaster#0403
maybe

[11] Silicon#2310
i will slam you against a table

[11] Toaster#0403
not saying it has to be MC

[11] JONKKKK#4186
and it could be expert mode because more ppl = more easy

[11] JONKKKK#4186
or not

[11] Toaster#0403
just any sandbox survival game with a ton of ppl would be really fun

[11] JONKKKK#4186
but i still think it would be fun

[11] Toaster#0403
MC is something that everyone already has

[11] Toaster#0403
not everyone has terraria

[11] GoldenPot8o#2294
Yeah ok

[11] GoldenPot8o#2294
It just weirded me out that you changed your mind

[11] JONKKKK#4186
i mean almost all of us have it

[11] Toaster#0403
like

[11] GoldenPot8o#2294
You’re often a stubborn bastard

[11] Toaster#0403
just MC by itself is pretty boring

[11] Toaster#0403
not v interesting

[11] Alterae#0258
I have more terraria than mc.

[11] Toaster#0403
gets boring fast

[11] Toaster#0403
but with a ton of ppl

[11] Toaster#0403
well

[11] Toaster#0403
ANY game with a ton of ppl would be really fun

[11] JONKKKK#4186
terraria gets boring less fast

[11] Toaster#0403
false

[11] JONKKKK#4186
i mean

[11] Toaster#0403
terraria gets grindy faster

[11] JONKKKK#4186
*ish*

[11] Toaster#0403
my point is

[11] JONKKKK#4186
but mc is also really grindy

[11] GoldenPot8o#2294
Also that’s one of the reasons I wanted to do MC at one point with you guys because the teen center server is really fun

[11] JONKKKK#4186
i still think we should try a terraria server

[11] JONKKKK#4186
haha you guys saw nothing

[11] Toaster#0403
literally any game gets more fun the more ppl you have

[11] Toaster#0403
like there are a couple where it might just add more clutter and get harder

[11] Toaster#0403
but the majority of games get more fun when you have more ppl

[11] Alterae#0258
Yup.

[11] JONKKKK#4186
ok this is how i see it

[11] Alterae#0258
Like Space Engineers, where if you have enough people you can do big space battles.

[11] JONKKKK#4186
there are like a million mc smps

[11] Toaster#0403
yeah and theyre all really fun

[11] JONKKKK#4186
but there arent too many terraria smps

[11] Toaster#0403
for the most part

[11] Toaster#0403
idk man im not that into terraria

[11] Toaster#0403
not being able to build in that extra dimension takes something out of it for me for some reason

[11] JONKKKK#4186
i mean we never get that far in

[11] Toaster#0403
plus theres like no automation

[11] GoldenPot8o#2294
Ding dong your opinion is wrong, Jonathan is bad so this song is long, so let’s all gather and sing this song for jonks opinion is totally wrong

[11] Alterae#0258
Jonk is wrong.

[11] JONKKKK#4186
yeah that part sucks

[11] Toaster#0403
like even just that small aspect of automation that we do in MC makes it that much better

[11] JONKKKK#4186
how am i wrong?

[11] Toaster#0403
but the only 2d building is just

[11] Toaster#0403
meh

[11] Toaster#0403
not as good

[11] JONKKKK#4186
i like 2d building a bit better

[11] JONKKKK#4186
idk why

[11] JONKKKK#4186
im just better at it

[11] Toaster#0403
cuz its easier so it dont require skill

[11] Toaster#0403
thats why xd

[11] GoldenPot8o#2294
Terraria is way less good than the lords game

[11] GoldenPot8o#2294
Besides jonk

[11] JONKKKK#4186
im not saying terraria is better

[11] Toaster#0403
terrarias almost less of a sandbox and more of a like "here upgrade ur armor so you can fight this boss and progress" to me

[11] JONKKKK#4186
but we've tried mc smps before and we always get kinda bored

[11] Toaster#0403
its not as focussed on building

[11] Toaster#0403
its way more fighting

[11] JONKKKK#4186
and im saying we should try a terraria smp

[11] Toaster#0403
cuz every mcsmp we do is like 4 ppl

[11] Silicon#2310
but what if we didnt

[11] Toaster#0403
walter is right

[11] GoldenPot8o#2294
You’re the one who kills it jonk

[11] JONKKKK#4186
no??

[11] GoldenPot8o#2294
Yeah what’s an smp

[11] GoldenPot8o#2294
Also yes

[11] JONKKKK#4186
survival multiplayer

[11] JONKKKK#4186
no i dont

[11] Toaster#0403
survival multyplayer

[11] JONKKKK#4186
i play more than you guys if anything

[11] Toaster#0403
how did this convo do a total 180 from berating me to berating jonathan

[11] Toaster#0403
not complaining but

[11] Toaster#0403
also jok not rly

[11] Toaster#0403
u play like a bit right at the start but then asi it goes on ur more and more like "naahhhh i dont rly wanna"

[11] GoldenPot8o#2294
Everyone is fine and then you stop playing and we all get bored because of it and also bullshit you leave in like a matter of hours

[11] Toaster#0403
getting like everyone in this discord server to get on an smp would be fun

[11] Toaster#0403
obv couldnt get every single person

[11] Toaster#0403
but having that amount of ppl would be great

[11] JONKKKK#4186
last time we played you guys all left and i stayed for a few more hours

[11] Toaster#0403
do u mean like

[11] Toaster#0403
how i had to go to sleep

[11] Toaster#0403
also AGAIN

[11] Toaster#0403
YOU PLAY FINE AT THE START AND DO PLENTY

[11] Toaster#0403
AND THEN JUST STOP

[11] JONKKKK#4186
all im saying is i dont do that with terraria

[11] Toaster#0403
you go from *that* (playing longer than us) to saying "nah i dont feel like it" whenever we ask you

[11] JONKKKK#4186
idk why but that happens less with terraria

[11] Toaster#0403
i think jonathan just shouldnt exist as part of this friend group

[11] Toaster#0403
im repromoting nate to epic gamer and demoting jonathan to cool kid

[11] JONKKKK#4186
why do you guys all hate me?

[11] Toaster#0403
we dont..?

[11] Toaster#0403
u just like very different things

[11] JONKKKK#4186
"i think jonathan just shouldnt exist as part of this friend group"

[11] Toaster#0403
conflicting interests are not good

[11] Toaster#0403
the majority of your contributions to us playing stuff is "nah i dont wanna"

[11] JONKKKK#4186
i mean ive been playing more recently...

[11] Toaster#0403
would you like to enjoy a game of
-brawl
-csgo
-grip
-scpsl (if we can get other ppl)
-mc (if we can get other ppl)
-shellshock
-duck game
-unturned (if we can get other ppl)
-gwyf
-roget leeg

with me

[11] JONKKKK#4186
i mean ill play mc

[11] JONKKKK#4186
ok ive been saying "i mean" a lot lol

[11] Toaster#0403
then lets get more ppl and start an smp

[11] Toaster#0403
conversation solved

[11] JONKKKK#4186
we already started an smp

[11] Toaster#0403
well

[11] JONKKKK#4186
we shouldn't restart

[11] Toaster#0403
then lets add more ppl to the smp

[11] JONKKKK#4186
ok

[11] JONKKKK#4186
so now who *else* wants to play

[11] Toaster#0403
@EPIC GAMERS @BIG BEOBLE

[11] Toaster#0403
@SMOL CHILDREN

[11] Alterae#0258
I don't have mc...
Well, I have on my phone, but Idk if that counts.

[11] Zildin#0532
i would but can’t

[11] Zildin#0532
gotta pack for two trips today

[11] JONKKKK#4186
yeah ill play if other people do

[11] JONKKKK#4186
and maybe if they dont?

[11] Silicon#2310
i will slam you against a table

[11] JONKKKK#4186
idk

[11] Alterae#0258
Are y'all doing Java edition?

[11] JONKKKK#4186
ye

[11] JONKKKK#4186
aka good edition xd

[11] Silicon#2310
fuck you

[11] JONKKKK#4186
ok but in bedrock you cant do the 1-block trapdoor thing

[11] Toaster#0403
well yeah

[11] Toaster#0403
java only good edition

[11] Alterae#0258
I haven't got java...

[11] Alterae#0258
I should buy it.

[11] Silicon#2310
you should dont

[11] JONKKKK#4186
you have terraria tho right?

[11] Toaster#0403
ok gtg on a bike ride xdddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddd im dying

[11] Silicon#2310
fuck you

[11] Toaster#0403
fuck u too walter

[11] Silicon#2310
yo'er a poo poo head

[11] Toaster#0403
no u

[11] Alterae#0258
I do have terraria.

[11] Alterae#0258
But mods might be an oof.

[11] JONKKKK#4186
yeah no mods

[11] JONKKKK#4186
mods gay xd

[11] Silicon#2310
fuck you

[11] Toaster#0403
yeah ill play modded terraria happily

[11] Alterae#0258
And I could prolly buy MC in very near future.

[11] Toaster#0403
ok cya

[11] Alterae#0258
Terraria Overhaul is great

[11] Toaster#0403
modded MC smp would also be fun but MC mods actually affect performance

[11] Toaster#0403
so

[11] JONKKKK#4186
terraria mods affect performance a bit too

[11] Toaster#0403
installing terraria mods isnt gonna make ur game crash like MC mods can

[11] Toaster#0403
wont noticably effect it

[11] JONKKKK#4186
yeah but im p sure i couldnt play too many mods on my old comp

[11] Toaster#0403
effect/affect

[11] JONKKKK#4186
the first was wrong, second was right

[11] Toaster#0403
shudup xd

[11] Silicon#2310
fuck you

[11] JONKKKK#4186
wait wait no

[11] JONKKKK#4186
second was wrong

[11] Toaster#0403
yeah terraria modded would be better than vanilla

[11] JONKKKK#4186
vanilla is still fun tho

[11] Toaster#0403
mc modded would also be better but thats more of an oof for bad pcs

[11] Toaster#0403
vanilla terraria is a lot of fighting and building takes like a sidestage to the fighting but MC is building and building = good

[11] Toaster#0403
well modded terraria is also fighting but

[11] Toaster#0403
it makes it more unknown so more interesting

[11] Toaster#0403
already know what to expect from vanilla

[11] JONKKKK#4186
i mean its not like you cant build in terraria

[11] JONKKKK#4186
its still kinda fun

[11] Toaster#0403
yeah but its not as good as in MC and it definitely is not the main focus of the game

[11] JONKKKK#4186
yeah, i agree

[11] Toaster#0403
MC is more like "hey look at all these really cool things you can build and make and automate but also you could fight if you *want* to"

[11] Toaster#0403
terraria is the opposite

[11] JONKKKK#4186
ok my opinion:

[11] JONKKKK#4186
minecraft is too build focused, terraria is too fight focused

[11] Toaster#0403
"hey look at all these really cool things you can fight and defeat and progress towards but also you could build if you *want* to"

[11] JONKKKK#4186
and i like that better if im being honest

[11] Toaster#0403
which

[11] Toaster#0403
fight?

[11] JONKKKK#4186
second one

[11] Toaster#0403
sooooooooooooooooooooooo why dont u like normal fighting games

[11] JONKKKK#4186
i *kinda* do

[11] Toaster#0403
nidhogg, csgo, literally any fighting game

[11] JONKKKK#4186
smash is p fun now that im getting better at it

[11] JONKKKK#4186
also splatoon is great

[11] Toaster#0403
yEAH SEE ITS ALMOST LIKE I WAS RIGHT

[11] Toaster#0403
WOW

[11] JONKKKK#4186
?

[11] Toaster#0403
i always told u if u just put in the time to get better at games like csgo or brawl or scpsl youd enjoy then more\

[11] Toaster#0403
and its CORRECT

[11] Toaster#0403
because ur doing that with smash

[11] JONKKKK#4186
well yeah

[11] JONKKKK#4186
i never said you were wrong

[11] Toaster#0403
just dump that time into games that this friend group plays and then youre golden

[11] JONKKKK#4186
its just that csgo isnt fun to get good at

[11] Toaster#0403
smash isnt either

[11] Toaster#0403
smash is so boring to get good at

[11] JONKKKK#4186
ehh

[11] JONKKKK#4186
i disagree

[11] Toaster#0403
just boring fighting over and over and over again

[11] JONKKKK#4186
its a good party game

[11] Toaster#0403
how boring

[11] Toaster#0403
and useless

[11] Toaster#0403
ok i gtg

[11] JONKKKK#4186
finally

[11] JONKKKK#4186
/s

[12] Shrooms#5080
"just boring fighting over and over and over again" says the person who loves duck game and stick fight

[12] Shrooms#5080
for once I agree with johnothan splatoon and smash are really fun

[12] Shrooms#5080
toaster is just mad because its nintendo

[12] Shrooms#5080
and not on pc

[12] JONKKKK#4186
(it totally should be tho)

[12] Shrooms#5080
o rly? why

[12] JONKKKK#4186
bc then you wouldnt have to buy a $300 system

[12] JONKKKK#4186
and nintendo would have to compete with other games on the platform

[12] Shrooms#5080
yeah I guess you're right

[13] JONKKKK#4186
@Toaster is the server up?

[13] JONKKKK#4186
the mc server?

[13] JONKKKK#4186
its not >:((

[14] Zildin#0532
but yeah smash is actually fun to get better at

[14] Zildin#0532
in my opinion because you can see what all players do, you can see where you're lacking and improve those areas

[14] Zildin#0532
but when I played csgo with toaster it was like alright time to do thi- whoop I got sniped by toaster

[14] Zildin#0532
plus smash fits multiple play styles that arent shooting

[14] casualwhitenut#1777
https://youtu.be/dNUdbi5ive0

[16] JONKKKK#4186
my oculus rift sensor wasnt working and i was scared for a second

[16] JONKKKK#4186
then i just whacked it

[16] JONKKKK#4186
and now it works

[16] JONKKKK#4186
good ol percussive maintenance

[17] Toaster#0403
@Shrooms i wasnt actually stating my opinion with the whole "wow smash is bad" thing

[17] Toaster#0403
i was just showing jonathan that wow you can say that about any game

[17] Toaster#0403
and @Zildin playing against me in a game is not a good way to learn how to play said game

[17] JONKKKK#4186
well this is how i see it

[17] JONKKKK#4186
smash has a singleplayer mode where the difficulty is customizable

[17] Toaster#0403
so does brawl

[17] JONKKKK#4186
so you can slowly ramp it up

[17] JONKKKK#4186
it does?

[17] Toaster#0403
mhm

[17] Toaster#0403
so does csgo

[17] JONKKKK#4186
bots dont count

[17] Toaster#0403
they do

[17] Toaster#0403
whatre you playing against in smash then?

[17] JONKKKK#4186
not in my opinion

[17] Toaster#0403
nothing?

[17] Zildin#0532
toaster you’re pretty much the only one i’ve played against without lag. i’ve tried online but it’s so slow i can’t do shit

[17] Toaster#0403
thats not my fault

[17] Zildin#0532
in fact it’s pretty slow a lot whenever i play

[17] Toaster#0403
thats on you/your internet

[17] JONKKKK#4186
well its bots but you set the difficulty with a number like 3.2 or something and the difficulty slowly ramps up

[17] Zildin#0532
it’s not but playing against you is normal speed.

[17] Zildin#0532
but it’s also you

[17] Toaster#0403
csgo is pretty bad when it comes to those things tho ive had a lot of difficulties with it

[17] Toaster#0403
its not me?

[17] Toaster#0403
what?

[17] Toaster#0403
playing with me does not make your internet better

[17] Toaster#0403
yeah jonathan

[17] JONKKKK#4186
ok how about we all just stop arguing and play some mc

[17] Toaster#0403
brawl and cs both have those

[17] Zildin#0532
i mean it kinda does

[17] JONKKKK#4186
they do?

[17] Zildin#0532
also it’s not the internet

[17] Zildin#0532
it’s the comp

[17] Toaster#0403
not as many difficulty options but

[17] Toaster#0403
what

[17] Toaster#0403
connor

[17] JONKKKK#4186
ok but wtv

[17] Zildin#0532
my computer is slow

[17] Toaster#0403
what the fuck are you talking about

[17] Zildin#0532
not the internet

[17] Toaster#0403
you mean 1v1ing is faster

[17] Toaster#0403
because less ppl

[17] Zildin#0532
yes

[17] Toaster#0403
1v1 servers exist

[17] Toaster#0403
this is a thing that exists

[17] Zildin#0532
where?

[17] JONKKKK#4186
what

[17] Zildin#0532
I never load up the game unless i’m gonna play with friends because I see no need to

[17] Toaster#0403
lemme just go to my favorited servers real quick

[17] JONKKKK#4186
hey toaster you should boot up the mc server

[17] Toaster#0403

https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/539106814697013250/584529047187619871/unknown.png

[17] Zildin#0532
ok?

[17] JONKKKK#4186
(or boot up a terraria server *hint hint nudge nudge*)

[17] Toaster#0403
the majority of those are surf or 1v1 servers

[17] JONKKKK#4186
but yeah we should play

[17] JONKKKK#4186
wait connor do you have terraria?

[17] Zildin#0532
but on a 1v1 server i could get paired with someone either  worse making it more annoying to find a good player or someone better making it seem like a huge chore to play the game i’ve barely played

[17] Zildin#0532
and yeah

[17] Zildin#0532
i have it

[17] Toaster#0403
1v1 servers are almost garaunteed to have ppl better than you

[17] Blanxy#6148
100%

[17] Toaster#0403
download a practice map or 5 and then p r a c t i c e

[17] Zildin#0532
with who?

[17] JONKKKK#4186
wait toaster do you know how to host a terraria server?

[17] Zildin#0532
the wall?

[17] Blanxy#6148
Bots dum dum

[17] Zildin#0532
if I’ve learned one thing about bots in competitive games it’s that they’re not too good at the game

[17] Zildin#0532
even at higher difficulties

[17] Zildin#0532
how many difficulty settings are there?

[17] JONKKKK#4186
practice maps arent bots

[17] JONKKKK#4186
its like

[17] JONKKKK#4186
"peek this hard angle on a target moving on tracks"

[17] Toaster#0403
*p r a c t i c e*

[17] JONKKKK#4186
ok but

[17] JONKKKK#4186
lets

[17] JONKKKK#4186
do

[17] JONKKKK#4186
stufffff

[17] Zildin#0532
i would but if it’s something i don’t find enjoyable i will quit rather quickly

[17] Zildin#0532
but how many difficulty settings are in csgo for boys

[17] Zildin#0532
*bots

[17] Zildin#0532
fucking autocorrect

[18] Toaster#0403
oh no its still doing it

[18] Toaster#0403
goddamn my internet just shat itself

[18] Toaster#0403
ok

[18] Toaster#0403
im back

[18] Toaster#0403
i exist

[18] Toaster#0403
i think

[18] JONKKKK#4186
is the server up?

[18] Toaster#0403
yeah but probably not the world u want

[18] JONKKKK#4186
chang it !!

[18] Toaster#0403
no

[18] JONKKKK#4186
what are you playing tho?

[18] Toaster#0403
minecraft

[18] JONKKKK#4186
no but

[18] JONKKKK#4186
-_-

[18] JONKKKK#4186
like what in mc

[18] Toaster#0403
14.2

[18] JONKKKK#4186
-_____-

[18] JONKKKK#4186
that didnt work

[18] JONKKKK#4186
why cant you do more than one underscore?

[18] JONKKKK#4186
ok wtv

[18] JONKKKK#4186
what world is the server on?

[18] Toaster#0403
the one i made at the teen center today

[18] JONKKKK#4186
aaaaaaggghhhhhhhhhh

[18] JONKKKK#4186
i liked the other world ;-;

[18] Toaster#0403
well then u shoulda played on it

[18] Toaster#0403
u gonna join or should i stop expecting something that wont come

[18] JONKKKK#4186
i mean

[18] JONKKKK#4186
i spent like 5 hours on that world

[18] Toaster#0403
no matter what the world was prolly gonna restart

[18] JONKKKK#4186
yeah and this one will too

[18] Toaster#0403
might even restart this one too if we get more ppl to agree to play

[18] JONKKKK#4186
YEAH SEE

[18] JONKKKK#4186
IM NOT PLAYING ON IT IF YOURE JUST GONNA RESTART IT

[18] Toaster#0403
you have dumb

[18] Toaster#0403
im gonna restart this world if we get a lot of ppl to play

[18] Silicon#2310
no

[18] JONKKKK#4186
why

[18] JONKKKK#4186
why do you need to restart when we get more ppl

[18] JONKKKK#4186
i get it if we're like 30 hours in

[18] JONKKKK#4186
but you really couldnt have made that much progress

[18] Toaster#0403
cuz as of now only 3 ppl have played on it (rly only 2) so if we get a ton more ppl then just start a new one so were all level

[18] Toaster#0403
oh god my internet

[18] Toaster#0403
i also just like this one bcuz it has fancy scoreboards i made 😄

[18] JONKKKK#4186
like on the side?

[18] Toaster#0403
yes that is correct

[18] JONKKKK#4186
you should make a way to toggle it for each person

[18] Toaster#0403
uh but how bout no

[18] JONKKKK#4186
because i personally dont like it on the side

[18] JONKKKK#4186
it just clutters stuff a bit

[18] Toaster#0403
oh no now instead of 1 thing on my hud it has ***2*** things

[18] Toaster#0403
whatever shall i do

[18] Toaster#0403
im almost at 1.5k blocks of stone mined

[18] Toaster#0403
yeah i like the scoerboards cuz they add some sense of competition even if its dumb competition

[18] JONKKKK#4186
ok but whats weird about that

[18] Toaster#0403
at least for me they do

[18] JONKKKK#4186
1.5k blocks is only a 12x12x12 space

[18] Toaster#0403
yeah but ive only been playing on this world for like <4 hrs

[18] JONKKKK#4186
*less* than that even

[18] JONKKKK#4186
yeah im not saying you didnt mine a lot

[18] JONKKKK#4186
im just saying its weird that 1.5k blocks is only 12x12x12

[18] Toaster#0403
u should join and just observe my stats xd

[18] JONKKKK#4186
or 12x5x25

[18] Toaster#0403
im on top of every leaderboard but deaths

[18] JONKKKK#4186
no thanks

[18] JONKKKK#4186
ill take your word for it

[18] Toaster#0403
ur the one who wanted to play MC my guy

[18] JONKKKK#4186
well yeah

[18] JONKKKK#4186
but i wanted to play on the other world

[18] JONKKKK#4186
i dont wanna spend 5 hours getting back to where i was

[18] Toaster#0403
so youll only play on a world every like week

[18] Toaster#0403
sounds good very fun

[18] JONKKKK#4186
no?

[18] JONKKKK#4186
i just like the part once we get 5+hours in

[18] Toaster#0403
this is the current trend im getting

[18] Toaster#0403
bcuz you play for like 5 hours and then just *stop* and then whenever i change the world to a new one SO MAYBE YOUD PLAY FOR ANOTHER 5 HOURS ur like "but i wanted the other oneeeeee"

[18] Silicon#2310
i will slam you against a table

[18] JONKKKK#4186
well ok

[18] JONKKKK#4186
you didnt play on it either

[18] JONKKKK#4186
if you were on and asked me to join i would GLADLY play

[18] Toaster#0403
bcuz nobody else was and i dont enjoy solo MC after a specific point

[18] JONKKKK#4186
well you couldve asked to play

[18] Toaster#0403
so youd rather that i went back to spamming you with @s until you play

[18] Toaster#0403
im trying to *not* do that jonathan

[18] JONKKKK#4186
no dont spam

[18] Toaster#0403
im not gonna beg you to play every time im on

[18] JONKKKK#4186
just

[18] JONKKKK#4186
do "@JONKKKK wanna play mc?"

[18] Toaster#0403
or or or

[18] Toaster#0403
how bout

[18] Toaster#0403
you just join the server

[18] JONKKKK#4186
rn?

[18] Toaster#0403
maybe notice when it says *playing **minecraft*** below my name and join

[18] Silicon#2310
i will slam you against a table

[18] JONKKKK#4186
toaster just *ask*

[18] JONKKKK#4186
you're putting all the pressure on me to notice when you're playing instead of just asking

[18] Toaster#0403
hey you know what i bet smps like carsons and also literally every other one do



not ask ppl to play they just get on

[18] JONKKKK#4186
alright

[18] JONKKKK#4186
ill play

[18] JONKKKK#4186
***if***

[18] JONKKKK#4186
you dont reset the world

[18] Toaster#0403
no promises

[18] Toaster#0403
just enjoy the world how it is and then if we get a ton more ppl

[18] Toaster#0403
i might reset

[18] Toaster#0403
maybe i wont

[18] Silicon#2310

Qu'est-ce que tu viens de dire à propos de moi, petite garce? Je vous ferai savoir que j'ai obtenu mon diplôme de haut de ma classe dans les Navy Seals et que j'ai participé à de nombreux raids secrets sur Al-Quaeda, et que j'ai plus de 300 morts confirmés. Je suis formé à la guerre des gorilles et je suis le meilleur tireur d’élite de l’ensemble des forces armées américaines. Vous n'êtes rien pour moi mais juste une autre cible. Je vais vous effacer avec une précision sans précédent sur cette Terre, marquez mes putains de mots. Tu crois que tu peux t'en sortir en me disant cette merde par Internet? Repense-toi, putain. Au moment où nous parlons, je contacte mon réseau d'espions secrets à travers les États-Unis et votre adresse IP est en cours de traçage pour vous permettre de mieux vous préparer à la tempête, mouche. La tempête qui efface la petite chose pathétique que vous appelez votre vie. Tu es putain mort, gamin. Je peux être n'importe où, n'importe quand, et je peux te tuer de plus de sept cents façons, et ce, à mains nues. Non seulement je suis très entraîné au combat à mains nues, mais j'ai également accès à tout l'arsenal du corps des marines des États-Unis et je vais l'utiliser pleinement pour essuyer votre pauvre cul du continent, merde. Si seulement vous pouviez savoir quelle vengeance impie votre petit commentaire "intelligent" allait provoquer, vous auriez peut-être tenu votre foutue langue. Mais vous ne pouviez pas, vous ne le faisiez pas, et maintenant vous en payez le prix, imbécile. Je vais chier la fureur sur vous et vous allez vous noyer. Tu es putain mort, kiddo.

[11] JONKKKK#4186
Because you should commit don't

[11] Silicon#2310

[11] MEE6#4876
You talk too much, @Alterae. You just advanced to level 8.

[11] Alterae#0258

[11] Alterae#0258
Thank you, stinky.

[11] Toaster#0403

[11] JONKKKK#4186
You should keep the old world

[11] Silicon#2310
you should kill yourself

[11] JONKKKK#4186
I mean

[11] JONKKKK#4186
Does it even have ores and caves?

[11] Toaster#0403

Huh.

[11] JONKKKK#4186
So is the world on the irl map?

[11] Toaster#0403
yes

[13] Toaster#0403
spawns for ores are definitely changed

[13] Toaster#0403
in places of the world where there is actually scientifically more gold, gold rates are increased

[13] Toaster#0403
coal spawns like crasy low down

[13] Toaster#0403
also coal veins have like a chance of getting a coal block in the middle

[13] Toaster#0403

[18] JONKKKK#4186
cant you put it in a doc?

[18] Toaster#0403
nono its not that i wont be able to transfer it

[18] Toaster#0403
its that this is a very rough version of what i really want to do

[18] JONKKKK#4186
ah ok

[18] Toaster#0403
so ill have to rewrite all of it and also have all of it be more complicated

[18] Toaster#0403
hoorat

[18] Toaster#0403
y

[18] JONKKKK#4186
also you should look at the video i sent because its actually hilarious

[18] Toaster#0403
i think im gonna make a youtube series out of it bcuz its actually a big project i feel like putting effort into

[18] Toaster#0403
also

[18] Toaster#0403
this is only one component of the whole project

[18] JONKKKK#4186
whats the project?

[18] Toaster#0403
this is the other part ive done which i can actually keep most of (only 71 lines)
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/539106814697013250/589611963236220961/image0.jpg

[18] JONKKKK#4186

[18] Toaster#0403
oh sry i keep switching to taking pics so i cant see ur messages

[18] JONKKKK#4186
lol

[18] JONKKKK#4186
ok lemme summarize:
watch above vid because g o o d
what project do

[18] Toaster#0403
-no im on a phone and am too lazy to go get earbuds
-basically simulating csgo games and matchmaking with factors like rank and hours played

[18] JONKKKK#4186
like

[18] JONKKKK#4186
just results?

[18] JONKKKK#4186
or actual theoretical gameplay?

[18] Toaster#0403
here is one round of one game of what that very long file does (all random number gen right now, not taking into account ranks or anything)
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/539106814697013250/589613032657911828/image0.jpg

heres another one
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/539106814697013250/589613152111558663/image0.jpg

[18] JONKKKK#4186
how do you kill while defusing?

[18] JONKKKK#4186
wait no

[18] JONKKKK#4186
alright

[18] Toaster#0403
lmao big brain

[18] JONKKKK#4186
im dumb

[18] JONKKKK#4186
dont mind me

[18] Toaster#0403
but yeah itll do whole games and then loop back and keep stats

[18] Toaster#0403
you can easily change timing on how long a “second” of a round takes, the delay between rounds restarting, and the delay between games

[18] JONKKKK#4186
i feel like you could easily modify that to simulate sploon games lol

[18] JONKKKK#4186
like

[18] Toaster#0403
prolly

[18] Toaster#0403
u could prolly do it with any game rly

[18] JONKKKK#4186
S+ TC

Match start!
the enemy team took the tower and is in the lead!
they lost the tower!
the enemies score is now 93.
we took the tower!
we took the lead!
we lost the tower!
we took the tower!
we lost the tower!
our score is now 65.
they took the tower!
etc.

[18] JONKKKK#4186
something like that

[18] Toaster#0403
the short program just generates (roughly) what other ppls ranks would be in a game with you, depending on the rank you input

its a bit complicated (obv lol, i think accurately simulating any game is difficult and its just made harder with how much strategy is put into csgo) but i think i have a good start and once i get home i can start making it a lot better

[18] JONKKKK#4186
oo oo try simulating 1v1s

[18] JONKKKK#4186
actually wait that would just be

player 1 killed player 2!
player 2 killed player 1!
player 2 killed player 1!
player 1 killed player 2!
player 2 killed player 1!
player 1 killed player 2!
player 1 killed player 2!
player 2 killed player 1!

[18] Toaster#0403
i mean thats just kinda like higher rank or higher hrs on 1v1 maps/servers wins

[18] Toaster#0403
coild even just let it be random but

[18] JONKKKK#4186
i mean what else would it be in lower ranks?

[18] Toaster#0403
reaction time i guess but u cant rly get that easily with python lol

[18] Toaster#0403
or aim

[18] Toaster#0403
but again cant rly get it

[18] JONKKKK#4186
unless you have a bomb or something ittl just be kills

[18] Toaster#0403
yeah

[18] JONKKKK#4186
ok yeah that was what i was saying

[18] Toaster#0403
yeah thats the only thing is i cant get reaction time or aim so i just have to kinda correlate hours to aim/better reaction time

[18] Toaster#0403
obv it wont be 100% accurate but its a fun project

[18] JONKKKK#4186
wait so whats going on in the bg?

[18] Toaster#0403
wot

[18] JONKKKK#4186
because it cant just be printing out strings at random

[18] Toaster#0403
oh no yeah thats why its 300 lines long lol

[18] JONKKKK#4186
is it actually simulating positions and stuff?

[18] Toaster#0403
no but i do plan on that (very roughly, probably just like ct, t, mid, a, b)

[18] Toaster#0403
its really just all random right now

[18] JONKKKK#4186
so why is it 300 lines?

[18] Toaster#0403
every second it gens a random number (which will generally increase in value as time goes on, but it is random so no guarantee) and if the number is > 5 it says “ok an action is happening” and then does a random num for if its a kill or bomb plant/defuse etc etc

the reason its 300 lines long (could probably be about 200) is mainly bcuz i copy pasted a big chunk of it bcus i was too lazy to make it all dynamic so i just ctrl-c ctrl-v and then changed what i needed to

[18] JONKKKK#4186
alrighty

[18] Toaster#0403
but its mainly a lot of math for the bomb defusing, i think thats the biggest part (and also the one i copied xd)

[18] JONKKKK#4186
lol

[18] JONKKKK#4186
also you know the amazing world of gumball?

[18] JONKKKK#4186
ok that was off topic

[18] JONKKKK#4186
but still

[18] JONKKKK#4186
it ended

[18] Toaster#0403
oh no

[18] JONKKKK#4186
on a cliffhanger tho

[18] JONKKKK#4186
like

[18] Toaster#0403
ok but back on topic xd

[18] Toaster#0403
this is half of the bomb code (only for CT)

[18] JONKKKK#4186
ok yeah

[18] Toaster#0403
oh fuck thats a lot of tabs

[18] JONKKKK#4186
how can you see my screen?

[18] JONKKKK#4186
/s

[18] Toaster#0403
ok that sorta helped on the beginning

[18] Toaster#0403
im too lazy to do it for the rest lol

[18] Toaster#0403
wait

[18] Toaster#0403
there

[18] JONKKKK#4186
i have no idea what you are talking about

[18] Toaster#0403
oh wait does it not show the code blocks for you?

it keeps saying "Your message could not be delivered because you don't share a server with the recipient or you disabled direct messages on your shared server, recipient is only accepting direct messages from friends, or you were blocked by the recipient."

[19] Toaster#0403
ill dm it to you?

[19] JONKKKK#4186
it might be more than 2000 chars

[19] Toaster#0403
```py
    if bomb == "planted":
        if yourTeam == "CT": # If you are on CT:
            defuseChance = randint(0, 5) - enemies # The chance you defuse it is 0-5 minus the enemy count
            if defuseChance == 0: # If the chance you defuse it is 0

                team -= 1
                # You lose```

[19] Toaster#0403
it sends that much wtf

[19] Toaster#0403
i dont think so

[19] Toaster#0403
yeah no its 1,858

IDFK it just be like that

[07] JONKKKK#4186
you should really clean your screen tho

[14] Toaster#0403
i think so but not sure

[14] JONKKKK#4186
is it on 1.14.1 or 2?

[14] Toaster#0403
btw spawn is in NM, my house is at like -3500 -1000 (x and z) or something close

[14] Toaster#0403
.2

[14] JONKKKK#4186
yeet

[14] GoldenPot8o#2294
i got bbt by the way

[14] Toaster#0403
wot

[14] Toaster#0403
oh battleblock?

[14] Toaster#0403
why lol

[14] JONKKKK#4186
he obviously means big bang theory

[14] Toaster#0403
ah yes my bad

[14] JONKKKK#4186
yeah

[14] JONKKKK#4186
thats why it ended

[14] JONKKKK#4186
he bought it

[14] JONKKKK#4186
and cancelled it

[14] Toaster#0403
ah okay makes perfect sense

[14] GoldenPot8o#2294
I’m doing the lords work

[14] Toaster#0403
nate when i get back we should try to s p e e d bbt

[14] GoldenPot8o#2294
i get home in -16 hrs

[14] Toaster#0403
i said when *i* get back

[14] GoldenPot8o#2294
oh wack

[14] Toaster#0403
big brain

[14] Toaster#0403
u should join jok on my serv so when i get back u guys have started

[14] Toaster#0403
btw /stats and /ustats

[14] JONKKKK#4186
i mean once you get back ittl inevitably be only a few days before you restart it

[14] Toaster#0403
can u srsly dont

[14] Toaster#0403
it prolly wont bcuz its a good map and i have a good start

[15] GoldenPot8o#2294
yeah and ittl be 3 hours before you give up jonk

[15] Toaster#0403
as long as other ppl (you guys) actually keep playing im fine

[15] Toaster#0403
^^^^^^yes nate

[15] JONKKKK#4186
but on all the other worlds i played for just as long as you guys

[15] JONKKKK#4186
which is why i dont like it when we restart

[15] GoldenPot8o#2294
i will mr blue sky montage you

[15] Toaster#0403
idk man i think its alot more of u kinda stopping and then i restart it cuz nobody’s playing on it and then you go ree

[15] Toaster#0403
what other worlds u even mean lol

[15] Toaster#0403
that ONE other one that we did recently

[15] Toaster#0403
?

[15] JONKKKK#4186
and the one before that

[15] JONKKKK#4186
i LOVED that world

[15] Toaster#0403
??

[15] JONKKKK#4186
the one where i had a chicken farm and the start of an actual base

[15] JONKKKK#4186
it was just getting good!

[15] JONKKKK#4186
the one where you lived in a jungle?

[15] Toaster#0403
bruh u stopped playing on that one

[15] GoldenPot8o#2294
wait im out of the loop how is it hosted

[15] Toaster#0403
on my comp

[15] GoldenPot8o#2294
ip?

[15] GoldenPot8o#2294
nvm

[15] Toaster#0403
mk lol

[15] GoldenPot8o#2294
just being dum

[15] JONKKKK#4186
ugh i dont really like this map that much

[15] JONKKKK#4186
its really rugged

[15] Toaster#0403
just go somewhere else? literally every biome

[15] JONKKKK#4186
wait, does this world have mushroom biomes?

[15] Toaster#0403
me and quinn walked to antarctica (idfk how but we just kept going south) and most of it was flat

[15] Toaster#0403
probably not

[15] JONKKKK#4186
so not EVERY biome

[15] JONKKKK#4186
but yeah ill try

[15] GoldenPot8o#2294
scale?

[15] JONKKKK#4186
1:4000

[15] Toaster#0403
ok every real biome how bout that lol

[15] JONKKKK#4186
right?

[15] Toaster#0403
yeah

[15] GoldenPot8o#2294
so smol boi yes?

[15] Toaster#0403
jonathan

[15] Toaster#0403
you javemt had any big projects in any of the worlds ove reset

[15] JONKKKK#4186
ok that actually seemed way more angry than i thought it would lol

[15] Toaster#0403
u havent had any big projects

[15] JONKKKK#4186
but tbh i dont like the earth maps

[15] Toaster#0403
tbh ur bad xd

[15] Toaster#0403
why not

[15] JONKKKK#4186
they're out of date

[15] Toaster#0403
what

[15] JONKKKK#4186
they have old villages and old generation

[15] Toaster#0403
wdym old generation its all custom gen

[15] JONKKKK#4186
meaning no bamboo, no new villages, etc

[15] JONKKKK#4186
yeah, but it was generated before those existed

[15] JONKKKK#4186
which means we'll never have it on those maps

[15] Toaster#0403
sooo -no new villages (oh no what a loss) and -no bamboo (oh no /give)

[15] JONKKKK#4186
i also think we should make a yt series out of it

[15] Toaster#0403
ok

[15] Toaster#0403
how about

[15] JONKKKK#4186
and it would be weird if it was on the world map

[15] Toaster#0403
when i get home

[15] Toaster#0403
i switch it to 1:2000

[15] Toaster#0403
and we start recording

[15] GoldenPot8o#2294
things i want to do
-panama canal
-tokyo 2 better boogaloo
-invade poland
-colonize iceland
-build big ben, then destroy it
-establish a communist united states

[15] Toaster#0403

[15] JONKKKK#4186

Idk

[22] Toaster#0403

[22] Blanxy#6148
An actual story would be better though

[22] Toaster#0403
so i wanna move away from ltjn (i agree with what u guys r saying right now but also just throwing this idea out there) so we could like give it an actual story and then have each person have a series on their own youtube channel showing parts of the series from their pov

[23] Blanxy#6148
I like that idea.

[23] GoldenPot8o#2294
idk

[23] GoldenPot8o#2294

[23] GoldenPot8o#2294
Explanation for elevator, often in Japan the entrance and exit are on different sides for the efficiency

[23] Zildin#0532
and in some asian countries bathrooms are just holes in the ground

[23] Zildin#0532
but i mean still

[23] GoldenPot8o#2294
Toilets are pretty simple, you see Japan actually has things called squatting toilets

[23] GoldenPot8o#2294
Not very common in tourist heavy areas

[23] Serendipity#3758

[09] Toaster#0403
thats literally how it starts

[09] Toaster#0403
he called a mans balls dry, empty, and sad

[09] Toaster#0403
because they were talking about how the chemicals in other soaps cause dry skin and low sperm count

[09] Toaster#0403

[15] Toaster#0403
think i like the wither less

[15] Toaster#0403
i have officially accidentally renamed my pickaxe to "diamond pickaxe33"

[15] JONKKKK#4186
why lol

[15] JONKKKK#4186
oh

[15] JONKKKK#4186
i have big brain

[15] Toaster#0403
i tried to put it in the 3rd slot of my inventory twice before realizing you cant in an anvil

[15] Toaster#0403
and i didnt realize i was typing in the name slot

[15] Toaster#0403
so

[16] Zildin#0532
honestly with correct prep the wither can be pretty easy

[16] Zildin#0532
it was probably a bug but when me a friend spawned a wither and trapped it in a small box it just sort of gave up

[13] JONKKKK#4186
?

[13] JONKKKK#4186
is that ur texture pack?

[13] Toaster#0403
no

[13] Toaster#0403
but its still fucking good as hell

[13] Toaster#0403
good as hec

[13] JONKKKK#4186
eh

[13] JONKKKK#4186
not my taste (?)

[13] Toaster#0403
thats your fault for having bad tastes that looks insanely good

[13] JONKKKK#4186
is that how the phrase goes?

[13] JONKKKK#4186
well i mean it looks *realistic*

[13] Toaster#0403
exactly

[13] JONKKKK#4186
its good for cinematic stuff but i would never use it day to day

[13] Toaster#0403
again thats on u for having bad tastes xd

[13] JONKKKK#4186
are you gonna use it in the smp?

[13] Toaster#0403
if it acts how i think it does (not sure) then i would totally use it

[13] Toaster#0403
yeah

[13] JONKKKK#4186
wdym?

[13] Toaster#0403
https://conquestreforged.com/

[13] JONKKKK#4186
how does it act?

[13] Toaster#0403
u see the fade from bottom blocks to top blocks how it fades from like messed up to less messed up

[13] JONKKKK#4186
does it just do that automatically?

[13] JONKKKK#4186
oh wait its a mod?

[13] Toaster#0403
think so

[13] JONKKKK#4186
i thought it was a texture pack

[13] Toaster#0403
i mean youd have to change how mc applies textures but u could do it with a pack

[13] Toaster#0403
well hm

[13] Toaster#0403
resource packs cant change where the textures are applied or how

[13] Toaster#0403
so no it has to be a mod

[13] JONKKKK#4186
oof

[13] Toaster#0403
aw man its only 1.12.2

[13] JONKKKK#4186
but yeah it looks decent but not *that* good

[13] Toaster#0403
w d y m

[13] Toaster#0403
it looks crazy good

[13] JONKKKK#4186
not good enough to justify using older versions

[13] JONKKKK#4186
yeah it just looks like that one texture pack on xbox

[13] Toaster#0403
it really dont tho

[13] JONKKKK#4186
like

[13] JONKKKK#4186
i dont see why you love it so much

[13] JONKKKK#4186
its p much just an hd texture pack

[13] Toaster#0403
it literally changes the way textures are applied to blocks jonathan

[13] JONKKKK#4186
how?

[13] Toaster#0403
did you even see the screenshot or the middle part of our conversation

[13] JONKKKK#4186
so its just that?

[13] Toaster#0403
i bet its a setting but blocks lower down look more beat up and everything is random or connected textures

[13] JONKKKK#4186
you could get a similar (albeit toned down) effect by mixing blocks

[13] Toaster#0403
yeah but thats stupid and also not nearly as cool

[13] JONKKKK#4186
i just dont like the look of it and also i like new versions

[13] Toaster#0403
u have bad

[18] Blanxy#6148
I'm bored and I wanna play a modpack

[20] JONKKKK#4186

[20] Zildin#0532
but yeah im not specifically looking for a pvp pack

[20] Zildin#0532

[20] Blanxy#6148
It’s not a pvp pack omg

[20] Blanxy#6148
But ok

[20] Blanxy#6148
No

[20] JONKKKK#4186

[20] Zildin#0532
??????/

[20] Zildin#0532

[20] JONKKKK#4186
they work they're just in beta i think

[20] Zildin#0532
oh ok

[20] JONKKKK#4186
also if the download icon is a grass block thing DONT CLICK IT

[20] Zildin#0532
wait will it work in older versions

[20] Zildin#0532
*click*

[20] JONKKKK#4186
if you download it for older versions

[20] Zildin#0532

[20] Zildin#0532
oof

[20] JONKKKK#4186
well

[20] Zildin#0532
what should the icon be

[20] JONKKKK#4186
java logo i think

[20] JONKKKK#4186
but look

[20] JONKKKK#4186

https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/539106814697013250/593632843809292328/unknown.png

[20] Zildin#0532
fuckin adfly

[20] JONKKKK#4186
it doesnt work with 1.13 because you cant play 1.13 on it

[20] JONKKKK#4186
because it boots up 1.14 and you cant change that without older copies of optifine

[20] JONKKKK#4186
you can still play 1.13 tho

[20] Zildin#0532
ok the download icon isnt a grass block or the java logo

[18] JONKKKK#4186
the "a+" is wrong

[18] JONKKKK#4186
it should be a "b-" because thats more realistic

[18] Toaster#0403
what does b stand for then

[18] JONKKKK#4186
you cant have too high of expectations

[18] Toaster#0403
a = append
w = write
r = read

[18] Toaster#0403
what does b mean

[18] JONKKKK#4186
that you got an 80-89%

[18] Toaster#0403
YES IT OWOASLDKFJ

[18] Toaster#0403
oh fuck wait

[18] Toaster#0403
oh no

[18] Toaster#0403
this is unfortunate

[18] Toaster#0403
goddamn it

[18] JONKKKK#4186
i mean i could maybe help you

[18] JONKKKK#4186
if you answer ONE question

[18] JONKKKK#4186
what are you doing?

[19] Toaster#0403
asdf AKSCDXXLKAFSDLKFJ

[19] JONKKKK#4186
if ur gonna test your program you should do it in the bot channel

[19] Toaster#0403
im not im just spamming because im angri

[19] JONKKKK#4186
why are you angri*?

[19] Toaster#0403
code no work

[19] Toaster#0403
module big dumb

[19] JONKKKK#4186
how he brek?

[19] Toaster#0403
module cant take input from keyboard and mouse at the same time because someone thought itd be a good idea to split the listeners into two different ones that you cant use at the same time

[19] Toaster#0403
so i can either record mouse clicks/movements
or record keystrokes

[19] JONKKKK#4186
just switch between them rlly fast

[19] Toaster#0403
but not both

[19] Toaster#0403
i c a n n o t

[19] JONKKKK#4186
what are you trying to do?

[19] Toaster#0403
very good keylogger

[19] Toaster#0403
but i cannot

[19] Toaster#0403
and am angri

[19] JONKKKK#4186
why lol

[19] Toaster#0403
i dont have anything else to do

[19] Toaster#0403
what would you code rn

[19] JONKKKK#4186
make something that generates random pixels of color

[19] JONKKKK#4186
and then rate each one

[19] JONKKKK#4186
and do ai to it

[19] JONKKKK#4186
bom you haf art maker

[19] JONKKKK#4186
OR

[19] Toaster#0403
wait lol

[19] Toaster#0403
from that i thought you emant

[19] Toaster#0403
it just generates 1 pixel of solid color

[19] Toaster#0403
and then we get ppl to rate it

[19] Toaster#0403
so we find the b e s t c o l or

[19] Toaster#0403
the subjectively best color

[19] JONKKKK#4186
oooo

[19] Toaster#0403
hey you know whos a gamer

[21] Toaster#0403
it goes up daily and also whenever you buy stuff on steam

[21] Toaster#0403
so you either gotta wait for it to go back up or buy a bunch of stuff

[21] JONKKKK#4186
oh

[21] JONKKKK#4186
wait so what does the limit mean?

[21] Toaster#0403

people dont want to be pinged for no reason stop doing @ everyone and just pinging random roles

[11] GoldenPot8o#2294
Hey so another dream

[11] Toaster#0403
oh no

[11] GoldenPot8o#2294
This one is, part of a like 6 part continuous storyline, but I’ll write down the full story in a doc at some point

[11] Toaster#0403
o h n o

[11] GoldenPot8o#2294
Also this story includes real and unreal people

[11] GoldenPot8o#2294
So

[11] GoldenPot8o#2294
Keep that in mind

[11] Toaster#0403
this is scaring me ngl gamer

[11] Toaster#0403
especially with how wacky dreams are

[11] GoldenPot8o#2294
So I’m in an airport (where I think the entire storyline takes place) with alexander, (the cool one) Izzy, and satchel and we’re just wandering around. And I’m sprinting full speed, for no reason, and I sprint down this hallway, which my brain has designated is just a hallway, and there’s a locked door at the end of this hallway at all times, and this time the door leads to an exhibit about creative writing, anyways about 6 feet in front of the locked door, there’s a metal detector, and Alexander sets it off, and there’s a new almost invisible sliding door next to the metal detector, the sliding door turns orange, and opens to an elevator just full of security guards, then one of the security guards asks Alexander what set off the detector. Then he pulls out one of those continuous metal bands that are spiraled together, I think they’re called a toroflux, and he folds it out and it’s a frisbee like thing that spins really fucking fast.

[11] GoldenPot8o#2294
The security guard at the front of the elevator says that it’s not allowed past the metal detectors, and the sliding door shuts, then we all sprint full speed back down the hallway, into a main area, then satchel, Alexander, and Izze are all forgotten by my brain and I walk over to the gate I’m supposed to be at, with my family, and again I see a character that is not a real person (I don’t think so) , and is a reoccurring character, my brain has named her wolf girl, I don’t know why she’s there, she just is, and she’s like the wolf version of a cat girl, anyways as my brain works, there is no boarding groups (or I just always miss them?) and the man who boards people calls out names, I go to do something (this part is blanked out) and I return to the gate but it’s almost empty besides my mom, some cognitively engineered friend of my mom, and one quarter of the terminal, my mom asks if I can get on now, and I board, I find a seat near the front and, it turns out that it’s right next to Alexander, then upon turning around, the three people behind me are izze, satchel, and wolf girl. I think I got a selfie with the group? And then it ended.

[11] GoldenPot8o#2294
I wanna say that this would make more sense if I gave you the rest of the story, (the first two episodes) but that might confuse you more, basically the premise that I picked up on is that the school has organized a trip to some currently unknown to me location on the east coast, and everyone invited, it’s probably the dream equivalent of Virginia Beach and San Francisco mixed together.

[11] Toaster#0403
w o l f g i r l

[11] Toaster#0403
bois nates dreaming about a wolf girl >v>

[11] Toaster#0403

How is it illegal?

[23] Toaster#0403
<18

[23] GoldenPot8o#2294
Because I was up at like 3am going down the internet chain, and I found that by accident and it was o d d

[23] casualwhitenut#1777
There is no law against watching porn under 18

[23] casualwhitenut#1777
It's being in a porn film

[23] GoldenPot8o#2294

O wow

[23] casualwhitenut#1777
Let's nuke em

[23] GoldenPot8o#2294
It’s anything involving underages and sexual content, that’s why R rated movies are 18+ requirements too

[23] casualwhitenut#1777

And if there is a law against watching porn underage why don't I need an Id or something of proof to watch it?

[23] GoldenPot8o#2294
Well the internet is hard to enforce that because you can’t just show your id to the camera, really it’s not illegal if you don’t get caught but like don’t rat yourself out either

[23] Toaster#0403
>this entire discord convo

[23] Toaster#0403

hey bapy when you wake up i made you armor

[13] GoldenPot8o#2294
So the dream itself doesn’t matter, but the character that arose from it does, it’s called the red man, he looks like a skeleton without ribs, and he’s made of red/black smoke, and he has a red painted tin can for a head, the can also has a really badly made smiley face painted on it, he leaves “ads” on scrap metal. The ads vary in design but two elements that always stay the same are the smiley face and a number, 432-4772, if you think of calling the number, it summons the red man, then he pins you down and asks you what you wish for. When you make a wish, it’s granted, but you become obsessed with the fact that your wish was granted, and you begin to deteriorate because of it. The red man inhabits your body at this point, and the only way to make someone snap out of the trance is to physically harm them by breaking the skin. But the red man tries to fight back using their body, and is very good at defending against attacks. Upon breaking the skin of the victim they bleed for about a second, all blood that escapes them is black, and when the second is up the wound is healed immediately, and after they stop bleeding the red man has exited their body, and the victim gets to keep their wish. This does not make the person immune to the red man however, and upon the second wish, you must remove the red man twice. Keep in mind that the red man is intelligent, and that he will quickly learn the way you fight and can counter much better upon the second removal.

[13] Zildin#0532
what if you wish red man to not exist

[14] JONKKKK#4186
(you're welcome)

[14] Toaster#0403
gg

[14] JONKKKK#4186
what does gauche mean btw

[14] Toaster#0403
like

[14] Toaster#0403
crude

[14] Toaster#0403
poorly made

[14] Toaster#0403
the quote “gauche as shit” is from bojack horseman, and he was using it to describe the great pyramids of egypt

[14] Toaster#0403
pyrmids of giza?

[14] Toaster#0403
forget the name but u get the point

[14] Toaster#0403
@GoldenPot8o are you at TC?

[14] Toaster#0403
if yes could you ask one of the staff:
if i bring some xbox controllers and a wireless adapter for PC, will they let me install the drivers for the adapter on a computer?

[14] Toaster#0403
or they could make it alot easier by just letting us use the ones they have instead of banning em ;;;;))))

[14] GoldenPot8o#2294
not there

[15] Toaster#0403
aw

[15] GoldenPot8o#2294
also they have controlers and a wireless adapter, and all the computers there have the drivers

[15] Toaster#0403
they just dont let u use the adapters?

[15] GoldenPot8o#2294
what no

[15] GoldenPot8o#2294
thats for the xbox 1 controlers

[15] Toaster#0403
i have asked if we could get controllers for pc and do a coop game and every time you have told me they dont allow it

[15] GoldenPot8o#2294
they dont let u use usb to micro usb because people kept making the cords all beat up

[15] Toaster#0403
so we CAN do wireless xbox 360 controllers with the PCs

[15] Toaster#0403
?

[15] GoldenPot8o#2294
I TELL YOU THAT YOU HAVE TO GET YOUR OWN CONTROLER FROM THE FRONT DESK oops caps, because they dont let you check out controlers for other people

[15] GoldenPot8o#2294
yes you can

[15] Toaster#0403

Ooh yeah

[00] GoldenPot8o#2294
Let’s remove all the good shit from soda

[00] GoldenPot8o#2294
“Idk man this kinda tastes like static”

[00] GoldenPot8o#2294
And then some 40yo mom chugged it and was like mmmmmmmmmmmmmm

[00] Toaster#0403
making things more carbonated makes them shit

like literally any soda is 10x better if you let it sit for a day so it has no carbonation

[00] GoldenPot8o#2294
Static

[00] Toaster#0403
carbonation in general is just ass

[00] GoldenPot8o#2294
And now I have to deal with red skittle flavored cosmic radiation taking up space in my fucking fridge, because I don’t have any ammo for my co2 rifle

[00] GoldenPot8o#2294
I’m gonna build an arsenal of weapons to commit sparkling water genocide

[00] Toaster#0403
im gonna build a weapon that just remove carbonation from every drink you point it at

[00] Serendipity#3758
Finally sane people

[00] GoldenPot8o#2294
I’m gonna build a high power solar laser and aim it at the space station

[00] GoldenPot8o#2294
Wait wait

[00] GoldenPot8o#2294
I just had a not so legal idea

[00] Toaster#0403
oh no

[00] GoldenPot8o#2294
But maybe like super legal I’m not sure

[00] GoldenPot8o#2294
Do you know how gas engines have fuel injector systems

[00] GoldenPot8o#2294

[00] GoldenPot8o#2294
And I know I could build it

[00] Toaster#0403

[00] GoldenPot8o#2294
Could be a side project along with split-hill

[00] Speguni#3116
Pat the gus in teh burrel to fir out chumber

[00] GoldenPot8o#2294
If I got the right size burrel and added more injectors I could use soda cans as shells and then purchase styrofoam and mix with the same gasoline as I’m using in the gas canister to make napalm, then put napalm in the can, fire the can and shoot napalm rounds out of a fucking scrap cannon

[00] GoldenPot8o#2294
That’s metal as fuck dude

[00] Toaster#0403

[13] Alterae#0258
Nice.

[13] GoldenPot8o#2294
i actually wanna work towards class a licence so i can drive anything

[13] Toaster#0403
why

[13] Toaster#0403
you have to take shit tons of classes and tests for every kind of vehicle

[13] GoldenPot8o#2294
cant let these haters know my next move

[14] Toaster#0403
unless your gonna be a truck driver when u get older then theres literally no point

[14] Toaster#0403
yeah you dont need a class a to drive tanks and planes are a different license and i cant think of anything else youd want to drive

[14] Toaster#0403
having a standard civi license (class c) is like having a provisional for driving tanks

[14] Toaster#0403
u can drive one if someone with a class h (treaded vehicle) license is in there with you

[13] Alterae#0258
Nice.

[13] Zildin#0532
wait @Toaster what version is the server in

[14] Toaster#0403
1.14.4

[14] Zildin#0532
ok thanks

[14] Zildin#0532
im gonna join probably

[14] Zildin#0532
hey @Toaster can you whitelist me to the server

[14] GoldenPot8o#2294
mc username?

[14] Zildin#0532
Zildin

[14] Toaster#0403
**Something I'm thinking of doing with the server:**
Getting worldguard (region selectiona and settings) and a permission plugin;
Setting up 3 ranks
-New (cannot edit anything in any towns/houses set with worldguard)
-Trusted (can edit anywhere)
-Admin (can do anything and has access to all commands)
Regions that new players cant edit would be towns and any individual houses people want admins to claim
this would take a little while to set up because permission plugins are kinda pee pee poo poo garbage but would probably do it when i get back from AK trip

Any opposition/ideas?

[14] Zildin#0532
thatd be great

[14] Zildin#0532
also if you dont have it 1 player sleep

[14] Zildin#0532
its sometimes painful getting everyone to sleep at once

[14] Alterae#0258
Sensible idea, toaster.

I should join the server sometime

[14] Zildin#0532
you can join now. i just did and am super late to the party

[14] Toaster#0403
I dont want to take away from the community kinda feeling of the server and make it all moderated and closely watched but having a way to keep people we arent sure about from griefing yet still let them join

[14] Zildin#0532
yeah that works

[14] Zildin#0532
so people can still do whatever except fucking with community areas or private property

[14] Toaster#0403
yeah

[14] Alterae#0258
Sensible.

[14] Alterae#0258
Very sensible.

[14] casualwhitenut#1777
you should add a moderator rank

[14] casualwhitenut#1777
that people can apply on a google form for

[14] Toaster#0403
nah ill just have friends and people whove played a long time as admins

[14] casualwhitenut#1777
ah

[14] casualwhitenut#1777
will i be able to finish my house with the new rank?

[14] Toaster#0403
yeah probably

[14] Toaster#0403
Pinned a message.

[14] casualwhitenut#1777
we should have a trade system if not a money system

[14] casualwhitenut#1777
like /trade and we can trade items with eachother

[14] Toaster#0403
we have one

[14] casualwhitenut#1777
whats the command

[14] Toaster#0403
not trading but we have money conversion

[14] casualwhitenut#1777
oh

[14] JONKKKK#4186
or we could just do it manually..

[14] casualwhitenut#1777
yeah but then we have to be in the same area

[14] Toaster#0403
mailboxes exist

[14] casualwhitenut#1777
oh

[14] casualwhitenut#1777
yeah

[14] casualwhitenut#1777

[20] Toaster#0403
or while streaming but idk why youd want thag

[21] casualwhitenut#1777
hey @Toaster could you whitelist my second minecraft account?

[21] casualwhitenut#1777
the ign is **reground**

[21] Toaster#0403
uh why the fuck

[21] casualwhitenut#1777
uhh why not

[21] Toaster#0403
because why the fuck u need two accounts on one server

[21] casualwhitenut#1777
i use both accounts on other servers tho

[21] Toaster#0403
seems shady as hell to me considering we literally know you have hacked clients

[21] casualwhitenut#1777
i deleted them

[21] casualwhitenut#1777
also its for when i go on vacation because i only have login for the other account on my laptop

[21] Toaster#0403
im not whitelisting any1 (and nate and jok shouldnt either) until i get back from my trip

[21] casualwhitenut#1777
oh

[21] casualwhitenut#1777
okay i guess

[21] casualwhitenut#1777
how long is your trip?

[21] Toaster#0403

[21] Soundwave#8803
@casualwhitenut  just add your account to your laptop ...

[21] Toaster#0403
^^^^

[21] casualwhitenut#1777

[21] Toaster#0403
r e s e t p a s s w o r d

[21] casualwhitenut#1777
login includes email

[21] casualwhitenut#1777
i dont remember which one i used

[21] casualwhitenut#1777
i have so many

[21] Toaster#0403
thats on u for being small brain

[21] casualwhitenut#1777
i am small brain sometimes but why cant i get whitelist on my other account too?

[21] casualwhitenut#1777
if you think im going to get banned on one and use the other, just add a plugin that IP bans

[21] Toaster#0403
cuz
-weve literally caught u using hacked clients
-seems shady as f u c c boiii
-am not whitelisting anyone until i get back

[21] Toaster#0403
also u can ip ban just from bukkit

[21] Toaster#0403
dont need a plugin for that

[21] casualwhitenut#1777
k so why dont do that if i hack again?

[21] Toaster#0403
i will

[21] casualwhitenut#1777
k

[21] casualwhitenut#1777
can nate or other admin whitelist me orr when you get bacc from trip

[21] Toaster#0403
no well just do it when i get back

[21] casualwhitenut#1777
k

[23] Toaster#0403
ah

[23] Zildin#0532
i died too but a deal with the devil saved my stuff

[23] Toaster#0403
then meyb say that instead of just “lost stuff due to lag spike”

[23] Zildin#0532
~~there was a platform below me~~

[23] Soundwave#8803
no we were building across lava but there was lots of drawback and i reloged and i fell and died in lava

[23] Soundwave#8803
well he was elytraing

[23] Zildin#0532
yeah

[23] Zildin#0532
i died becuase i cant fly

[23] Soundwave#8803

[23] Toaster#0403

[23] Zildin#0532

[23] Soundwave#8803

[23] Zildin#0532
i mean i spent a few solid hours total fishing

[23] Soundwave#8803
yo you will come back to an awesome guardian farm and diamonds and maybe beacons if we get there

[23] MEE6#4876
You talk too much, @Soundwave. You just advanced to level 2.

[23] Soundwave#8803

[23] Toaster#0403
i want to take part in making stuff

[23] Soundwave#8803
hey there is still a lot that is gonna need to be done

[23] Zildin#0532
oh trust me the guardian farm is painful

[23] Toaster#0403
yeah yeah lol

[23] Toaster#0403
but again

[23] Zildin#0532
I will gladly wait for you

[23] Toaster#0403
a week is a long time bois

[23] Soundwave#8803

[23] Soundwave#8803
oof

[23] Toaster#0403

[23] Zildin#0532
like what

[23] Soundwave#8803
oooh

[23] Soundwave#8803
?

[23] Toaster#0403
this is taking fucking forever to send hol up

[23] Toaster#0403
the top 2 are the really big ones but i might also reform the discord
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/539106814697013250/604908240446423050/image0.jpg

[23] Soundwave#8803
o

[23] Soundwave#8803
i think top 3 is most important

[23] Toaster#0403
yeah

[23] Toaster#0403
bottom one is more just slightly helpful but not needed

[23] Soundwave#8803
me and tiso friends and the damage thing sucks

[23] Zildin#0532
yeah

[23] MEE6#4876
You talk too much, @Zildin. You just advanced to level 12.

[23] Toaster#0403
yeah i cant do anything while on travel but once i get back

[23] Toaster#0403
stuffs gonna happen

[23] Soundwave#8803
yay

[23] Soundwave#8803
you should stream the changes

[23] Toaster#0403
also will probably split the streamnotifs role into 3 roles, one for me, one for nate, one for jonathan

[23] Zildin#0532
ooh that’d be neat

[23] Toaster#0403
teah i prolly will

[23] Toaster#0403
any other suggestions for the discord/mc server

[23] Toaster#0403
im down to do stuff so

[23] Soundwave#8803
cool

[23] Soundwave#8803
what pluggins do you use?

[23] Toaster#0403
skript, plugman, soon to use worldguard and probably permissionsex but well see about permission stuff

[23] Toaster#0403
think thats all but not sure

[23] Toaster#0403
u can do /plugins on the server

[23] Soundwave#8803
cool

[23] Soundwave#8803
o ok

[23] Soundwave#8803
i think silk spawners would make everyone happy

[23] Toaster#0403
o yeah

[23] Soundwave#8803
get like 16 blaze spawners

[23] Soundwave#8803
oh yea that is one farm

[23] Zildin#0532
yeah if there’s a plug-in that lets you get different spawners but for like an arm and a leg that’d be neat

[23] Soundwave#8803
silk

[23] Soundwave#8803
touch

[23] Soundwave#8803
spawners

[23] Zildin#0532
oh yeah right

[23] Zildin#0532
wait that works?

[23] Toaster#0403
should i make my MC server trello board public and have a suggestion part

[23] Soundwave#8803
as a plugin

[23] Zildin#0532
what toaster

[23] Soundwave#8803
idk

[23] Zildin#0532
i’m not big brain littler works

[23] Zildin#0532
*words

[23] Toaster#0403
basically let u suggest stuff on what i use to keep track of what i need to do

[23] Soundwave#8803
thatd be cool

[23] Zildin#0532
yeah but make it as a separate list

[23] Zildin#0532
so the main one won’t flood

[23] Soundwave#8803
yo i need to go good night you guys

[23] Zildin#0532
night

[23] Toaster#0403
yeah right now i have todo and done but would probably add suggestions and denied suggestions

[23] Toaster#0403
gnite

[23] Zildin#0532
ok but how does silk touching a spawner work?

[23] Toaster#0403
its a plugin

[23] Zildin#0532
ah

[23] Zildin#0532
does the mob stay in?

[23] Toaster#0403
lets u mine spawners with silk touch to get them as an itsm

[23] Toaster#0403
yeah

[23] Zildin#0532
nice

[23] Zildin#0532
time to try and make some farms with this

[23] Zildin#0532
like blaze

[23] Toaster#0403
well its not on there yet

[23] Zildin#0532
cuz that’d be nice

[23] Zildin#0532
yeah lol

[23] Zildin#0532
but it’d be cool

[23] Zildin#0532
can they spawn if in water

[23] Toaster#0403
idk

[07] Soundwave#8803
@JONKKKK are you able to help me with my items?

[08] Tisokii#3172
yeah i lost everything

[08] Tisokii#3172

[08] Tisokii#3172

[08] Tisokii#3172

[08] Tisokii#3172

[09] JONKKKK#4186

[09] Soundwave#8803

[09] MEE6#4876
You talk too much, @Soundwave. You just advanced to level 3.

[09] Soundwave#8803
And i’m hoping on now

[10] Toaster#0403
@JONKKKK sill spawners is a plugin that lets you mine soawners with silk touch and get the itsm

[10] JONKKKK#4186
oh ok

[10] JONKKKK#4186
that seems a little op but eh

[10] Toaster#0403
yeah idk

[10] Toaster#0403
ppl want it tho so

[10] GoldenPot8o#2294
It’d be cool if you could change what the spawner is by putting an item from the mob you want to change it too into the spawner

Hey everybody i will be giving away all of these items dm and join the game and tell me what you need and i will try and gift it to you, P.S. hey toast i know your on vacation so don't worry i will save you some stuff

[11] GoldenPot8o#2294
Elytra and a few shulker boxes is all I want

[11] GoldenPot8o#2294
You can mail them to me

[11] Soundwave#8803
aight

[11] Soundwave#8803
so elytra, set of 8 shulker?

[11] GoldenPot8o#2294
Yeah 8 boxes not shells

[11] Soundwave#8803
well that would be 16 shells i think 4 boxes is fair cause everyone will want some and i dont plan on going to the end unless i want to build a base

[11] GoldenPot8o#2294
Ok

[11] Soundwave#8803
whats your mb

[11] Soundwave#8803
@GoldenPot8o

[11] GoldenPot8o#2294
Oh I’ll have to check

[11] Soundwave#8803
o ok

[11] Toaster#0403
i think well probably stop giving people stuff when they die, regardless of if it was caused by lag or not, just because at how much stuff we have you should just have stuff saved up anyways so if you dont then thats on you

[12] GoldenPot8o#2294

[18] Toaster#0403

[19] GoldenPot8o#2294

[19] Toaster#0403
gg no re

[19] JONKKKK#4186
but actually what happened

[19] Toaster#0403
he said

[19] Toaster#0403
every wall but one is odd

[19] Toaster#0403
which isnt that confusing

[19] JONKKKK#4186
nono

[19] Toaster#0403
odd + odd = even so if theres one wall that equals the length of two other walls thennnnnn

[19] JONKKKK#4186

[21] Soundwave#8803
jimbo?

[23] Toaster#0403
hey gamers ik its like 11:30 where u are (nat and jok and whoever else is on MST) but ive thought about this idea for a bot and just wanted to get opinions

[23] GoldenPot8o#2294
hit me

[23] Toaster#0403
if/when we reset the world (not to imply well do it soon, were all still enjoying this one) i think itd be cool to do a smp on amplified, could be called ASMP or somethin idk

[23] Toaster#0403
just feel like survival on an amplified world would be really fun

[23] Toaster#0403
again not to say that im gonna reset the world soon bcuz im not gonna

[23] GoldenPot8o#2294
lemme just uum

[23] GoldenPot8o#2294
ASM~~P~~ R

[23] Toaster#0403
b r u h

[23] Toaster#0403
but yeah doing amplified smp would be rly fun

[23] GoldenPot8o#2294
thats not a bot

[23] Toaster#0403
i think so, at least

[23] Toaster#0403
also other thing

[23] Toaster#0403
in announcements i put the link to my list of stuff to do for the server

[23] Toaster#0403
feel free to suggest stuff on that

[23] Toaster#0403
and/or just look at what im planning and talk about it

[23] Toaster#0403
ASMP could stand for a couple things lol

amplified survival multiplayer
anarchy survival multiplayer
absolutely shitty multiplayer

[23] GoldenPot8o#2294
a stranger minecraft playthrough

[23] GoldenPot8o#2294
also i made a suggestion

[23] Toaster#0403
ass shit my piss

[23] Toaster#0403
that is all i have to say

[23] GoldenPot8o#2294
well i dont know what to say

[23] Toaster#0403
thank you for the anti suggestion

[23] GoldenPot8o#2294
im ***suggesting*** that the rest of you pick a side

[23] Toaster#0403
and the two sides areee....?

[23] GoldenPot8o#2294
Potato Inc. and well

[23] GoldenPot8o#2294
the other ones

[23] Toaster#0403
im already allied with you in our bonemeal producing scheme

[23] GoldenPot8o#2294
everybody has a grey area

[23] GoldenPot8o#2294
you see

[23] Toaster#0403
everything you do blurs some line

[23] Toaster#0403
dunno which ones

[23] Toaster#0403
but it do

[23] Toaster#0403
also you should hold off on doing/starting anything drastic till i get back ples

[23] GoldenPot8o#2294
im allied with major parts of the loosely formed government on this planet, i have the working class on my side and am undertaking plans to cement the need for me in the server's economy and the server's populous

[23] Toaster#0403
i feel like thats impossible but ok

[23] GoldenPot8o#2294
im probably being overdramatic again ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

[23] Toaster#0403
unless you are going to make it so literally everyone doesnt have access to some literally *essential* item/group of items and that you have a monopoly on said group/item then idk how youre gonna make that work

[23] Toaster#0403
but again ples hold off on any monopolies or drastic schemes and such until i get back and can document it

[23] GoldenPot8o#2294
you got it boss

[23] Toaster#0403
1 minute until august

[23] Toaster#0403
2, really

[00] GoldenPot8o#2294
WHO THE FUCK BROKE THE ENDERFARM

[00] GoldenPot8o#2294

[00] GoldenPot8o#2294
The endermite is gone

[00] Soundwave#8803
Oohhhhhh

[00] GoldenPot8o#2294

[00] Soundwave#8803
I am so sorry

[00] GoldenPot8o#2294
*cart

[00] GoldenPot8o#2294
Oh

[00] Soundwave#8803
I did that on accident

[00] GoldenPot8o#2294
Nice

[00] Soundwave#8803
I thought you meant like destroyed it

[00] GoldenPot8o#2294
No

[00] Soundwave#8803
Do I need to come and fix it?

[00] GoldenPot8o#2294
No I’m off now

[00] Soundwave#8803
Oh ok cool

[00] Soundwave#8803
I’m making villager farm tomorrow

[00] Soundwave#8803
And carrot/potat farm

[07] Toaster#0403
bruh i was askin for not that much automation until i get back (at l e a s t) and you come in here and just make like 5 farms in a week calm down

[07] JONKKKK#4186
i just read the above messages and i think that amplified would be fun

[07] JONKKKK#4186
but yeah everyone here likes automation which is why we're making farms

[07] JONKKKK#4186
that rule just kinda ruins the fun for us

[07] Toaster#0403
yes but i also will want to make farms and if i come back to 5+ new farms im gonna have nothing to do

[07] JONKKKK#4186
ig

[08] Toaster#0403
guaranteed: im gonna get back and soley because i missed out on so much will have kinda lost interest in the mc stuff and even though ill still play on it ill start streaming other stuff more because playing minecraft every day for 5 hours wont be fun anymore

[08] Toaster#0403
not saying that doing other stuff is a bad thing

[08] Toaster#0403
but i g u a r a n t e e i will have lost interest in the mc world at LEAST a bit

[08] JONKKKK#4186
just build:
town
shop
company
house

[08] JONKKKK#4186
thats what you told me at least

[08] Soundwave#8803
yo i have verything accept achievements and a trident i can do practically anything for u and u just build and enjoy yourself

[08] Toaster#0403
yeah i probably will but its not fun to do stuff like that unless there are people to do it with or have community fun or whatever with and i cant build a company or shop because i have nothing to sell because everythings already automated

[08] Soundwave#8803
talk about getting bored i play 12 hrs on it most days so i have everything i could want (accept a trident)

[08] JONKKKK#4186
nah theres still lots of stuff that we dont have

[08] JONKKKK#4186
we dont have a reliable source of gunpowder

[08] Soundwave#8803
^

[08] Soundwave#8803
or gold

[08] Soundwave#8803
or iron

[08] JONKKKK#4186
and we could actually build a guardian farm

[08] Soundwave#8803
could but enderman are better

[08] JONKKKK#4186
nah guardian farms are faster

[08] Soundwave#8803
it goes to lvl 30 in 30 seconds not 2 mintes

[08] Soundwave#8803
i know this because i did it

[08] Toaster#0403
all im sayin is i will inevitably have lost interest

[08] Soundwave#8803
wellllllllll

[08] Soundwave#8803
we will have to see

[08] Toaster#0403
sounds like nates being a gamer bcuz hes planning community stuff but

[08] Toaster#0403
idk mannnn

[08] JONKKKK#4186
if you stop thinking of it as inevitable maybe you wont but if you keep on saying that you'll lose interest* it *will* be inevitable

[08] Toaster#0403
that is defo false but ok

[08] Soundwave#8803
i agree with jonk

[08] Toaster#0403
its not like i *want* to lose interest but just because i missed out on a week of stuff AND you guys did a ton if stuff in that week its pretty much whatll happen

[08] Soundwave#8803
hey toast i will have you armour just like mine for the dragon when you get back

[08] MEE6#4876
You talk too much, @Soundwave. You just advanced to level 6.

[08] Toaster#0403
m a y b e if i just didnt interact with you guys for a week and just worked on my own stuff in solitude until i kinda caught up (especially since just kinda breaking off and doing your own chill thing is fun anyways) but thatd be boring for other obvious reasons

[08] JONKKKK#4186
im pretty sure giving him stuff will be counterproductive

[08] Soundwave#8803
??????????

[08] Toaster#0403
yeah ^^^^^^ just throwing OP gear at me will def make me more bored

[08] Soundwave#8803
ok nevermind then

[08] JONKKKK#4186
i mean we *could* get you elytra because you'll need them for the giant end raid

[08] Soundwave#8803
^

[08] JONKKKK#4186
(assuming you'll wanna go to the end cities)

[08] Soundwave#8803
i upvote this post

[08] Toaster#0403
not rly lol

[08] Toaster#0403
exploring the end doesnt seem that interesting to me but

[08] Toaster#0403
well see

[08] JONKKKK#4186
well you'll probably want shulkers n stuff

[08] Toaster#0403
meh

[08] Toaster#0403
your the one whos always like “bruh sound effect bro we gotta have elytra and shulker boxes”

[08] Toaster#0403
idrc about that stuff

[08] Soundwave#8803
lol

[08] JONKKKK#4186
i mean its still useful and im p sure we're all gonna do it together so you might as well be there

[08] Toaster#0403
i did in fact say well see at the end of that

[08] JONKKKK#4186
oh ok lol

[08] Toaster#0403
as of right now no thanks but i am not home right now and we are not doing it right now

[08] JONKKKK#4186
but yeah im probably gonna get elytra for you because imma end bust later anyway

[08] Soundwave#8803
hey jonk i couldnt find the seed in chat do you think sometime you could dm it to me?

[17] Toaster#0403
thats an oof

[17] Soundwave#8803
lol

[17] Soundwave#8803
well im past that now

[17] Toaster#0403
is it like 9th are seperated from the rest of the high school?

[17] Soundwave#8803
yea

[17] Soundwave#8803
so its a school with 8th and 9th or you go to the middle school thats 6-8

[17] Toaster#0403
ah ok we have something kinda like that but its really just the school trying to get more money xd

[17] Toaster#0403
ohhh

[17] Soundwave#8803
xD

[17] Alterae#0258
Ye grade 9 is kinda sorta a separate school/

[17] Soundwave#8803
im did ms then 9

[17] Alterae#0258
But it's in the same campus and buildings as the high school.

[17] Alterae#0258
And it's basically just a cash-grab

[17] Toaster#0403
our high school has a thing to “ease in” middle schoolers which is just a seperate building for core classes

[17] Soundwave#8803
same campus just a football field away

[17] Toaster#0403
but yeah^^^^^ just cash grab lol

[17] Alterae#0258
I mean I'm all for the distric getting cash.

[17] Alterae#0258
As long as they use it well.

[17] Toaster#0403

[13] casualwhitenut#1777
Hey toaster, whats that thing you use to use your PC remotely?

[13] Alterae#0258
Chrome remote access I think.

[13] casualwhitenut#1777
mk

[13] MEE6#4876
You talk too much, @casualwhitenut. You just advanced to level 7.

[13] casualwhitenut#1777
what about parsec is that good?

[13] Alterae#0258
Idk what that is.

[13] JONKKKK#4186
no thats only for games

[13] JONKKKK#4186
and you have to have ppl on both ends

[13] JONKKKK#4186
i think

[13] casualwhitenut#1777
oh

[13] casualwhitenut#1777
so google remote desktop?

[13] JONKKKK#4186
ye chrome remote desktop

[13] casualwhitenut#1777
okay lemme try it out, whats the internet requirements?

[13] JONKKKK#4186
idk

[13] JONKKKK#4186

[13] casualwhitenut#1777
game with lowest latency about 2800 miles away from my rig

[13] JONKKKK#4186

[13] JONKKKK#4186
yeah ur gonna need good internet

[13] JONKKKK#4186

[13] casualwhitenut#1777
like how many megabits p/s?

[13] JONKKKK#4186
i have no idea

[13] JONKKKK#4186
but you need someone on the other end to set it up

[13] casualwhitenut#1777
i have my laptop with me rn and im just tryna get it setup for when i go on vacation

[13] JONKKKK#4186
oh ok

[13] JONKKKK#4186

[13] casualwhitenut#1777

[13] casualwhitenut#1777

[13] JONKKKK#4186
its chrome remote desktop not google remote desktop

[13] casualwhitenut#1777
same thing

[13] casualwhitenut#1777
chrome is google

[13] JONKKKK#4186
not nessecarily but yeah its called chrome remote desktop so google that

[13] JONKKKK#4186
you wont get much if you google google remote desktop

[13] casualwhitenut#1777
okay i got chrome remote desktop working

[13] casualwhitenut#1777
and its alright, the quality is low

[13] JONKKKK#4186
yeah its not rlly designed for gaming

[13] JONKKKK#4186
and *maybe* parsec will work idk much about it

[13] casualwhitenut#1777
okay

[13] casualwhitenut#1777
ill give it a look

[13] casualwhitenut#1777
hmm what about nvidia moonlight??

[13] casualwhitenut#1777

[13] JONKKKK#4186
idk

[13] casualwhitenut#1777
Update, Parsec is a lot more crisp than chrome remote desktop

[13] JONKKKK#4186
can you use it without someone on the other end?

[13] casualwhitenut#1777
ya

[13] casualwhitenut#1777

[13] casualwhitenut#1777
ofc you hvae to login and stuff but it works

[13] casualwhitenut#1777

[15] GoldenPot8o#2294
No parsec can be enabled to do remote access

[15] GoldenPot8o#2294
Jonk is wonky

[15] casualwhitenut#1777

ok so that episode was about a thumb war and one character plays video games a lot and was beating everyone in a button mashing game and they ended up winning the competition

[18] JONKKKK#4186
but it turns out he just bribed everyone

[18] JONKKKK#4186

[18] JONKKKK#4186

[19] Alterae#0258
Don't look.

[19] Alterae#0258
Don't fucking look.

[19] casualwhitenut#1777
what is it

[19] JONKKKK#4186
its not nsfw or anything just really really REALLY bad

[19] Alterae#0258
Y'know that's one thing furries are good for.

If any of them had worked on the movie it wouldn't be so terrible.

[19] JONKKKK#4186
its a cgi movie where people are cats or something

[19] casualwhitenut#1777
wtf

[19] casualwhitenut#1777
thats gay

[19] Alterae#0258
No.

[19] Alterae#0258
It's just awful.

[19] JONKKKK#4186
it has *trancended*

[19] casualwhitenut#1777
its trans gender

[19] casualwhitenut#1777
its wrong

[19] Alterae#0258
Nah.

[19] casualwhitenut#1777
yes

[19] Alterae#0258
Wrong, ye.

[19] casualwhitenut#1777
its fucking gay

[19] casualwhitenut#1777
ew

[19] Alterae#0258
But it's nothing to do with lgbt folk and suggesting otherwise is honestly annoying.

[19] casualwhitenut#1777
it looks like a terrible cgi movie

[19] JONKKKK#4186
yeah what will said ^

[19] Alterae#0258
It is.

[19] Alterae#0258
THank you jonk.

[19] casualwhitenut#1777
has it come out yet lmao

[19] casualwhitenut#1777
if so i wanna kill everyone who sees it

[19] JONKKKK#4186
no i dont think so

[19] casualwhitenut#1777
good

[19] casualwhitenut#1777
its super bad

[19] casualwhitenut#1777
its like sonic

[19] casualwhitenut#1777
but worse

[19] Alterae#0258
Yeah.

[19] casualwhitenut#1777
x2

[19] Alterae#0258
Again at least according to the internet this could have been averted if we'd just had a furry or two doing character design.

[19] JONKKKK#4186
yeah but then it would be rated R

[19] JONKKKK#4186
/s

[19] casualwhitenut#1777
furies are gay

[19] casualwhitenut#1777
if you like furies you can leave

[19] Alterae#0258
I never said I do.

[19] Alterae#0258
And also plenty of furries are straight.

[19] casualwhitenut#1777
n oi

[19] casualwhitenut#1777
no u

[19] Alterae#0258
So your analysis is factually incorrect.

[19] casualwhitenut#1777
theyre all gay

[19] casualwhitenut#1777
and stupid

[19] JONKKKK#4186
i feel like furies would be the plural of fury

[19] Alterae#0258
Yeah it is.

[19] Alterae#0258
Oh fuck.

[19] JONKKKK#4186
because you spelled it wrong lol

[19] Alterae#0258
Yeah it is actually.

[19] casualwhitenut#1777
lmao

[19] Alterae#0258
Fury -> furies.
Furry -> furries.

[19] Alterae#0258
One is a creature from Greek myth, and the other's a furry.

[19] casualwhitenut#1777
and furies are the stupid things

[19] JONKKKK#4186
so what are furries?

[19] casualwhitenut#1777
some random greek myth

[19] casualwhitenut#1777
so they dont actually exist

[19] Alterae#0258
Honestly if they ain't fucking animals or something I don't think I care.

If you get off to anthropomorphic animals then that's your buisiness.

[19] Alterae#0258
Actually know it's furies that are mythological.

[19] casualwhitenut#1777
no its furries

[19] casualwhitenut#1777
not furies

[19] casualwhitenut#1777
furries is the myth

[19] casualwhitenut#1777
furies is stupid gay shit

[19] Alterae#0258
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erinyes
Wikipedia says no.

[19] casualwhitenut#1777
Wikipedia is gay aswell

[19] casualwhitenut#1777
stop using facts

[19] casualwhitenut#1777
please

[19] Alterae#0258
Ah yes that totally makes sense I absolutely surrender to your obviously superior debate skills.

[19] Alterae#0258
/s

[19] casualwhitenut#1777
yeah

[19] casualwhitenut#1777
thanks

[21] JONKKKK#4186
you're calling calling things gay gay

[21] JONKKKK#4186
wait i confused myself

[21] JONKKKK#4186
its almost recursive but in a lame way

[21] Toaster#0403
also matt i must also say that
1) its fuccin furry not fury
2) furries arent usually that bad, its just a case of the bad minority being loud, and to quote will (roughly) who cares if u get off to anthro animals

[21] Toaster#0403
your whole convo with each other hurt my soul

[21] JONKKKK#4186
so before you were saying that by saying that by saying that by saying that by saying that by saying that by saying that by-

[21] JONKKKK#4186

[06] Alterae#0258
!

[06] Alterae#0258
So yesterday on Reddit I got 5k upvotes, four silver awards, one gold award, and a fucking PLATINUM.

All basically because I didn't know my ABCs just right.

[06] Toaster#0403

https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/539106814697013250/607556233897181185/image0.jpg

[06] Toaster#0403
reddit flexing is for peepoo brains

[06] Alterae#0258
Somebody did, though.

[06] Alterae#0258
I never asked for awards.

I never asked for any of it

[06] Toaster#0403
yeah but whether you ask for it or not going into a discord chat and saying “lul i got 25bil upvotes and 90 platinum by AcCiDeNt” is still reddit flexing and thats peepeepoopoo

[07] Alterae#0258
I mean kinda but mostly you're just being salty and you should stop.

[07] MEE6#4876
You talk too much, @Alterae. You just advanced to level 10.

[07] Alterae#0258
Thanks, Stinky.

[07] Toaster#0403
yea im sorta salty just because reddit flexing is peepeepoopoo and you just did it

[07] Toaster#0403
you just did something that I am annoyed by, is that not a reason to be annoyed

[07] Alterae#0258
I mean it is and your annoyance is valid but at the same time I'm a little miffed because I feel like you're kinda shitting on my good day because you're in a bad mood.

[07] Toaster#0403
am abt to get on plane btw i will hafta go

[09] JONKKKK#4186
uhh

[09] JONKKKK#4186
lol

[09] Soundwave#8803

[09] Alterae#0258
Light green is more like actual food packaging.

[09] Alterae#0258
Gives like a "fesh", "organic" aesthetic

[10] Alterae#0258
Yup.

[11] Toaster#0403
one flight down

[11] Toaster#0403
one to go

[11] Alterae#0258
Nice.

[11] Toaster#0403
and then a two hour drive

[11] Alterae#0258
Did you get the window seat?

[11] Toaster#0403
yeah

[11] Alterae#0258
Window seats are best.

[11] Alterae#0258
What airline?

[11] Toaster#0403
idk bout the next flight tho

[11] Toaster#0403
alaska

[11] Alterae#0258
Also can I just say there is NOTHING BETTER than the sight of the inside of Albuquerque airport after all the other airports.  THEY ARE SO GREY and then abq has nice warm brown and turquoise and it's so fucking refreshing after a long day of flying.

[11] Toaster#0403
hehe

[11] Toaster#0403
i like the largeness of other airports better kinda idk how to explain it

[11] Alterae#0258
Yeah I get that.

[11] Alterae#0258
They've got a certain *energy*.

[11] Alterae#0258
But they're also so fucking GREY.

[11] Toaster#0403
big airports like (surprisingly) the one in anchorage AK are really nice

[11] Alterae#0258
And that gets old.

[11] Toaster#0403
yeah sure

[11] Alterae#0258
I've been to BWI.

[11] Toaster#0403
imo it kinda has a sweet spot

[11] Alterae#0258
And buffalo's airport.

[11] Alterae#0258
They're both kinda similar.

[11] Toaster#0403
dallas is too big where its just annoying to get to

[11] Toaster#0403
to go anywhere*

[11] Alterae#0258
And then ABQ is like actually aesthetically different

[11] Alterae#0258
never been to Dallas.

[11] Toaster#0403
the one in AK is really moderb and nice and has some cool art

[11] Alterae#0258
Oh nice.

[11] Toaster#0403
they have an entire hallway where the cieling is meant to simulate the aurora

[11] Alterae#0258
Niiiice.

[11] Toaster#0403
time to sleep for another 3 hours and then wake up for a small amount of time and then sleep for 2 more and then be home

[11] Alterae#0258
Nice.

[11] Alterae#0258
I never sleep on planes.

[11] Alterae#0258
On flight from BWI to ABQ back in march or whatever I was sitting with these two little kids who were also from LA.

[11] Toaster#0403
i get tired on literally any form of transport that i am not driving so

[11] Toaster#0403
i usually end up sleeping

[11] Alterae#0258
Oof.

[11] Alterae#0258
I can't sleep during the day or while sitting up.

[11] Toaster#0403
damb

[11] Alterae#0258
Also these little kids were actually really well behaved.

[11] Alterae#0258
The younger one needed to be reminded about seatbelts a few times.

[11] Alterae#0258
But they were chill.

[11] Toaster#0403
hehe

[11] Toaster#0403
ok i gtg

[11] Toaster#0403

[12] Toaster#0403
bane of arthropods in french is "fléau des arthropodes" which translates to plague of arthropods and that is way cooler than bane

[12] Jacob._.#5479
its so dark

[12] JONKKKK#4186
he has shaders

[12] Jacob._.#5479
I know

[12] Toaster#0403
fun fact: the enderman farm is probably whats making the server so laggy cuz it wasnt laggy before it existed and its about 100+ entities all in one place

[12] Spymasterjimmy#9506
true

[12] JONKKKK#4186
i mean theres no enderman when nobodys in the end

[12] Toaster#0403
cuz i had a cow farm with like 200 cows and that killed my server which had 16gb of ram dedicated to it

[12] Toaster#0403
this server has 2gb

[12] JONKKKK#4186
well they get unloaded when nobodys around

[12] Toaster#0403
yeah thats true but

[12] Toaster#0403
whenever the servers being laggy check if anyone in the end

[12] Toaster#0403
also jonathan i must point out that while im ok with automation (for the most part) now

[12] Toaster#0403
this is a very good reason to not allow it

[12] JONKKKK#4186
ye

[12] JONKKKK#4186
(not saying we should)

[12] Toaster#0403
if yall are gonna build farms like this then you either gotta start donating a collective 50 bucks every month or not complain about lag

[13] JONKKKK#4186

[08] JONKKKK#4186
no

[08] Toaster#0403
im not gonna get any plugins ive browsed like literally all of the 1.14 plugins and i have only gotten the ones i want

[08] Toaster#0403
the only things you can suggest that we will get are ones we already have

[08] Soundwave#8803
they are datapacks

[08] JONKKKK#4186
yeah but they just make things easier

[08] Toaster#0403
then extra no

[08] JONKKKK#4186
they add no depth

[08] Toaster#0403
because im too lazy to install datapacks

[08] Toaster#0403
and also ^^^^^^^^

[08] JONKKKK#4186
its just

[08] JONKKKK#4186
easy mode

[08] Toaster#0403
and thats a fact

[08] JONKKKK#4186
but yeah just make a drowned farm

[08] Soundwave#8803
they are complicated

[08] Soundwave#8803
idk how or how to find one that works

[08] Toaster#0403
thats how its s u p p o s e d t o b e

[08] Toaster#0403
wow look at that i just searched it and then went to the videos tab

[08] Toaster#0403
how will i ever know how to make a drowned farm with all of these helpful tutorial videos telling me how oh no

[08] Toaster#0403
i will never survive

[08] Soundwave#8803
^

[08] Soundwave#8803
correct

[08] Soundwave#8803
but come on this one is atleast fun

[08] Toaster#0403
no

[08] Soundwave#8803
fucken hell your picky

[08] Toaster#0403
i dont wanna install datapacks

[08] Toaster#0403
datapacks are annoying to install

[08] Soundwave#8803
no they arent

[08] Toaster#0403
yeah they are

[08] Toaster#0403
its plugins except you have to restart the entire server whenever you install one

[08] Soundwave#8803
press download, put in folder, restart  server

[08] Soundwave#8803
3 easy steps

[08] Soundwave#8803
simple

[08] Toaster#0403
yes

[08] Toaster#0403
but thats 1 more step than with plugins

[08] Toaster#0403
and also all the datapacks youre suggesting are not that good

[08] Toaster#0403
for reasons that jonathan has stated

[08] JONKKKK#4186
yeah pvp playerheads will just encourage pvp

AWWWW man

[13] Toaster#0403
connor you dont even play on the server wtf are you doing

[13] Zildin#0532
i used to

[13] Zildin#0532
and i should probably play on it more

[13] Toaster#0403
also makysym whats your discord username cuz we probably know you by that if you play on the server

[13] JONKKKK#4186
mc you mean?

[13] Toaster#0403
if you havent played on the server then GET OUTTA MY POLL

[13] Toaster#0403
yeah i meant mc

[13] Toaster#0403
@Maksym11713

[13] Maksym11713#9157
Lol i dont play on the server

[13] Toaster#0403
i thought so lul

[13] Maksym11713#9157
But y'all should invite me

[13] Maksym11713#9157
I WANN A JOIIIIIIIIN

[13] Toaster#0403
wdym bruh its literally pinned in announcements

[13] Toaster#0403
no whitelist

[13] Maksym11713#9157
O ok

[13] Toaster#0403
but if you havent played on it then why dont u want it to reset? genuinly curious as to that one

[13] Maksym11713#9157
I WANN see

[13] Maksym11713#9157
*wann

[13] Toaster#0403
cuz i must say that while i am all in favor of democracy I am the one paying monthly to host the server and I very much want to reset it to amplified

[13] Toaster#0403
so unless we get an overwhelming amount of "no"s AND ppl actually start playing on it again then itll prolly reset

[13] Toaster#0403
cuz if you just say "no dont reset it" and then dont play on it your opinion doesnt count

[13] JONKKKK#4186
its not like anything will change for you bc you usually build underground lol

[13] Toaster#0403
but in amplified there so much MORE underground

[13] Toaster#0403
and you can do way cooler stuff with it

[13] Maksym11713#9157
Yea, it'd probably lag my really computer

[16] TheFireDragoon#1756
they're all new accounts

[16] Serendipity#3758
Damn why

[16] TheFireDragoon#1756
tbh pretty sure we just need to ban literally everyone in the server list who's thing says they're a new user since that seems to be literally all of them

[16] TheFireDragoon#1756
a 4chan user probably

[16] TheFireDragoon#1756
wow they didn't even post close together that time

[16] JONKKKK#4186

FactionsUUID is a paid plugin

[16] SauronBSMC#3972
https://gyazo.com/c37773bc3aece4f9a57663647bea64fe

[16] SauronBSMC#3972
https://blackspigot.com/downloads/factionsuuid.11956/ <<-- free lmao

[16] SauronBSMC#3972
We buy it, then remove the IDs that are automatically injected by SpigotMC as anti-piracy. Then upload it.

[16] SauronBSMC#3972
Actually. Everything is owned by Mojang, everything made in minecraft is owned by Mojang (and Mojang is owned by Microsoft)

[16] SauronBSMC#3972
So if they sell plugins they are selling a part of their code, which is pretty much copyright infringement too

[16] Zildin#0532
ok so what the hell happened

[16] SauronBSMC#3972
nothing

[16] SauronBSMC#3972
we are talking

[16] Zildin#0532
i come back to here and see the aftermath of a raid/spammed/bullshit

[16] JONKKKK#4186
he started spamming toaster on stream, toaster befriended them

[16] JONKKKK#4186
watch the stream if you wannna hear both sides of the convo

[16] Zildin#0532

[16] SauronBSMC#3972
I did spam him lmao

[16] Zildin#0532

[16] JONKKKK#4186

[16] SauronBSMC#3972

[16] JONKKKK#4186
not really

[16] Zildin#0532
yeah

[16] JONKKKK#4186
ur just making ur website seem more sketchy if anything lol

[16] Zildin#0532
imho fuck spam advertising

[16] Zildin#0532
but jonk what was the whole people spam joining

[16] JONKKKK#4186

[16] SauronBSMC#3972
https://account.mojang.com/documents/commercial_guidelines

[16] JONKKKK#4186
he was controlling them

[16] Zildin#0532
why the fuck

[16] JONKKKK#4186
¯\_(ツ)_/¯

[16] Zildin#0532
~~then why is he still here~~

[16] TheFireDragoon#1756
so uh what's happening

[16] Alterae#0258
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQdxHi4_Pvc
I found this video.

[16] TheFireDragoon#1756
all i can understand is the guy running the bots also runs a piracy service

[17] Zildin#0532
yeah pretty much

[17] JONKKKK#4186
yeah thats p much it

[17] Zildin#0532
why is he still here then

[17] SauronBSMC#3972
i don't run it lol

[17] TheFireDragoon#1756
yeah why is he here

[17] Zildin#0532
this all seems sketchy af

[17] Alterae#0258
This is very sketch.

[17] SauronBSMC#3972
Just a Head of Staff, not the hoster

[17] Zildin#0532
but like...

[17] Zildin#0532
why?

[17] TheFireDragoon#1756
seriously why is this guy still here toast

[17] TheFireDragoon#1756
all he's done is spam the discord and then basically advertise an illegal service

[17] Alterae#0258
Yeah.

[17] JONKKKK#4186
yeah idk toaster doesnt think he did anything bad

[17] Zildin#0532
bruh

[17] Alterae#0258
And if I want piracy I do it myself thankyouverymuch.

[17] TheFireDragoon#1756
bruh

[17] Alterae#0258
bruh

[17] JONKKKK#4186
oh nvm nothing malicious*

[17] Zildin#0532
i mean i don’t remember this many people on the server

[17] Zildin#0532
are you sure you got all of them

[17] Zildin#0532
there’s 2 that are identical except the number

[17] Cardbot#3588
give me your credit card number

[17] JONKKKK#4186
a lot of ppl are from strems and stuff

[17] TheFireDragoon#1756
nah there's a few strays

[17] TheFireDragoon#1756
if you click on the profile and it says they're new to discord

[17] Zildin#0532
there are two named aka DJ

[17] TheFireDragoon#1756
80% chance that's one of the bots

[17] JONKKKK#4186
no they were real accounts hijacked

[17] Zildin#0532
hmm

[17] Alterae#0258
Oof.

[17] TheFireDragoon#1756
anyways even if he did nothing malicious he's still basically advertising a piracy site and he also got a bunch of bots to spam??

[17] Zildin#0532
essentially

[17] Alterae#0258
Yeah.

[17] Alterae#0258
And spam *is* malicious when it's this spammy.

[17] Zildin#0532
it’s not fun

[17] SauronBSMC#3972
Well. I don't see any spam advertising.. do you?

[17] MEE6#4876
You talk too much, @SauronBSMC. You just advanced to level 2.

[17] Zildin#0532
people spam is still spam

[17] SauronBSMC#3972
I don't even know the ip lol

[17] Zildin#0532
to what?

[17] SauronBSMC#3972
the mc server

[17] Zildin#0532
probably for the best

[17] Alterae#0258
Definitely.

[17] SauronBSMC#3972
yes

[17] SauronBSMC#3972
duh

[17] JONKKKK#4186
he uhh

[17] JONKKKK#4186
he got in

[17] Zildin#0532
to the server?

[17] JONKKKK#4186
yeah

[17] Zildin#0532
oof

[17] Alterae#0258
Ah shite.

[17] Zildin#0532
that’s not good

[17] Alterae#0258
Well I'm never active there anywyas lol.

[17] Zildin#0532
i mean same but still

[17] Alterae#0258
But I have a bad feeling 'bout this...

[17] Zildin#0532
if i go back i want to be able to stay alive

[17] JONKKKK#4186
we're watching him lol

[17] Zildin#0532
and not have my house destroyed

[17] Alterae#0258
oof

[17] TheFireDragoon#1756
idea: instead of just watching the guy who both advertised a piracy site he's head admin on or something and spammed the discord, ban him?

[17] Alterae#0258
Maybe.

[17] Serendipity#3758
I agree

[17] Zildin#0532
toaster repinned the ip so thats probably how

[17] Zildin#0532
jonk is it the same server?

[17] Toaster#0403
that was after he got it

[17] Zildin#0532
oh ok

[17] Alterae#0258
oof

[17] SauronBSMC#3972
Ban me?

[17] Zildin#0532
wait toaster is it the same server?

[17] Toaster#0403
wdym

[17] SauronBSMC#3972
poll

[17] Spymasterjimmy#9506
What’s happening?

[17] Zildin#0532
did you reamke the server or no?

[17] Toaster#0403
what

[17] Zildin#0532
the mc server

[17] JONKKKK#4186
k hes banned

[17] JONKKKK#4186
from mc

[17] Zildin#0532
is it now an amplified world or the same world

[17] JONKKKK#4186
same world

[17] Zildin#0532
oh ok

[17] Zildin#0532
nice

[17] TheFireDragoon#1756
tl;dr: sauron gets in server, gets bots to spam server with random stuff, sauron then advertises a piracy site he's head on, and then got into the mc server ~~and isn't banned on the discord~~

[17] SauronBSMC#3972
yeah. at least give it a reason

[17] Cardbot#3588
give me your credit card number

[17] JONKKKK#4186
dooo iiiit

[17] Serendipity#3758
No give me it

[17] Cardbot#3588
give me your credit card number

[17] SauronBSMC#3972
The Ban Hammer has spoken! is not a "valid" reason

[17] Zildin#0532
i mean it is

[17] Toaster#0403

[17] Spymasterjimmy#9506

[17] Spymasterjimmy#9506
Many

[17] Zildin#0532
lol yeah

[17] Toaster#0403
were yall talking about banning him from the discord or the MC server because it very much felt like yall were talking about the discord

[17] Toaster#0403
theres not much bad he can do on the MC server

[17] Zildin#0532
is the permissions thing set up?

[17] Toaster#0403
yes

[17] Toaster#0403
it has been for like 2 weeks

[17] Zildin#0532
are you on the server

[17] Toaster#0403
yes

[17] Zildin#0532
ok

[17] Zildin#0532
imma try and join server

[17] Serendipity#3758
I mean, we don't have to ban him,  as long as he doesn't do what he did again rite

[17] Zildin#0532
i mean maybe?

[17] Spymasterjimmy#9506
we said the same thing about soundeave

[17] Spymasterjimmy#9506
Wave

[17] Zildin#0532

[17] Spymasterjimmy#9506

what hack?

[17] Alterae#0258
You see if this were my server Sauron would be kicked half an hour ago, and/or banned ten minutes ago.

[17] Alterae#0258
But it's not my server.

[17] Toaster#0403
he was using impact

[17] Zildin#0532
??

[17] Toaster#0403
hacked client

[17] Zildin#0532
ok

[17] Toaster#0403
he was using baritone (pathfinding) and xray hacking

[17] Toaster#0403
aswell as flying n such

[17] Zildin#0532
oof

[17] Alterae#0258
why the fuck

[17] Serendipity#3758
This is all just  w a c c

[17] Alterae#0258
Why would you even hack in *survival*.

[17] Alterae#0258
Like if it's competitive or something I'd see why you could be motivated.

[17] Alterae#0258
But not in normal survival.

[17] Alterae#0258
THat's beyond lazy.

[17] Toaster#0403
its cuz its tedious

[17] Alterae#0258
Eh

[17] JONKKKK#4186
hey connor watch the stream if you wanna hear what we're saying

[17] SauronBSMC#3972
```./rg flag __global__ build deny```

[17] Serendipity#3758
?

[17] SauronBSMC#3972
nvm

[17] Serendipity#3758
uhh

[17] SauronBSMC#3972

[17] Alterae#0258
./?

[17] Alterae#0258
What is this?  Linux?

[17] Serendipity#3758
``?``

[17] Toaster#0403
dafuq are you talking about

[17] SauronBSMC#3972
yo toast, unban me

[17] Alterae#0258
`./file` would be a lame way to access a `file` if it's in the folder you're looking at.
`.` is the current folder you're in.

[17] Toaster#0403
thats not a linux thing

[17] Toaster#0403
thats just a code thing

[17] Toaster#0403
and thats not what he was doing

[17] Alterae#0258
i mean it's common in unix

[17] Zildin#0532
also toaster is there a way to make it so nobody can interact in your houses without permissions

[17] SauronBSMC#3972
back

[17] JONKKKK#4186

```java
package main;

import java.util.Scanner;

public class main {
    public static void print(String in) {System.out.println(in);}
    public static void iprint(int in) {System.out.println(in);}

    // Easy print functions

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String fname;

        // Contains first, last, or username

        // Ask user to enter a valid password until they do so
        // Output all values when a valid password is entered

        while ((pword.length() < 8) || (pword.toLowerCase().contains(fname.toLowerCase())) || (pword.toLowerCase().contains(lname.toLowerCase())) || (pword.toLowerCase().contains(uname.toLowerCase()))) {
            print("\nThat was an invalid password!");
            print("Passwords must be more than 8 characters in length,");

[06] Serendipity#3758

[07] Zildin#0532
you stupid bitch

[07] HollowRisk#0001

[07] Zildin#0532
well you see

[07] JONKKKK#4186
you could have like

[07] JONKKKK#4186
gotten a new computer with that money

[07] Zildin#0532
when you spend 1k, it’s gambling

[07] Zildin#0532
when i do, i get a half decent computer

[07] HollowRisk#0001
It’s not gambling if most of the time I get what I want by buying it off the steam market, i have only bought around 100-150 worth of gambling

[07] JONKKKK#4186
but like

[07] JONKKKK#4186
*why*

[07] Zildin#0532
it’s fucking cosmetics

[07] Zildin#0532
logan #may-mays

[07] Tarnished_Star#8193
Hec

[07] HollowRisk#0001
I already have pc worth 1k

[07] Zildin#0532
it’s like when people buy a couple thousand v-bucks

[07] HollowRisk#0001
So I don’t need that

[07] Zildin#0532
it’s cosmetics

[07] Zildin#0532
it does nothing

[07] HollowRisk#0001
Very cool looking  : )

[07] Zildin#0532
then save it for something that isn’t bad

[07] Zildin#0532
and no

[07] Zildin#0532
the experience is the exact same

[07] Zildin#0532
there is no reason to

[07] HollowRisk#0001
Cosmetics help the game make money and my friends happy because they get gifts

[07] HollowRisk#0001
It’s a win win

[07] Alterae#0258
My laptop has dead battery.

[07] Alterae#0258
Am sad

[07] Zildin#0532
so your friends get happy when you waste money

[07] Zildin#0532
great friends

[07] HollowRisk#0001
It’s not a waste if I enjoy it

[07] Zildin#0532
it is if it’s a look

[07] HollowRisk#0001
I could say you are wasting your money by going to school

[07] Zildin#0532
that’s like if you had to pay to use texture packs

[07] JONKKKK#4186
what

[07] Zildin#0532
and you really can’t

[07] JONKKKK#4186
school is free

[07] Alterae#0258
Nothing wrong with spending money on cosmetics.

[07] Zildin#0532
not all the classes

[07] HollowRisk#0001
School isn’t free jonk

[07] Alterae#0258
Is a personal choice

[07] HollowRisk#0001
You have to pay fees bruh

[07] Zildin#0532
and how is school a waste

[07] JONKKKK#4186
oh well yeah

[07] Alterae#0258
Support the devs

[07] HollowRisk#0001
I never said it was a waste

[07] JONKKKK#4186
but its 150 dollars, not A THOUSAND

[07] HollowRisk#0001
I said I could say it was a waste

[07] Toaster#0403
idk man college expensive

[07] Zildin#0532
yeah lol

[07] Toaster#0403
just sayin he coulda been talkong abt that

[07] Alterae#0258
And would you rather the game charge for non-cosmetics.

[07] Toaster#0403
not advocating for quinn cuz he dum as hell but you could definitely point out that school is a waste of money

[07] Zildin#0532
i’m not super against purchasing cosmetics i just don’t understand the reasoning

[07] JONKKKK#4186
i mean if you didnt go to school you like

[07] HollowRisk#0001
Because I like cosmetics and they are very cool!

[07] JONKKKK#4186
couldnt get a job

[07] Toaster#0403
thats cuz we live in a society

[07] JONKKKK#4186
college is another story but

[07] Toaster#0403
usa kinsa stupid as fuc

[07] Tarnished_Star#8193
Having one cosmetic is alright

[07] Zildin#0532
but games should have methods of acquiring cosmetics without spending a shit ton of money

[07] MEE6#4876
You talk too much, @Zildin. You just advanced to level 13.

[07] Tarnished_Star#8193
Thats true

[07] HollowRisk#0001
You can acquire cosmetics in DotA with spending a cent

[07] Alterae#0258
Yes

[07] Zildin#0532
that’s good

[07] Alterae#0258
What Connor said

[07] HollowRisk#0001
I choose to spend the money

[07] Tarnished_Star#8193
Otherwise you end up reaching the limit on your card

[07] Zildin#0532
so you’ve chosen to spend 1k on cosmetics

[07] HollowRisk#0001
Yes

[07] Alterae#0258
See I just use whatever cosmetics I get from gameplay.

[07] Toaster#0403
dumb man ^

[07] Toaster#0403
oh wait

Just stop trying to understand, it’s a schedule issue

[15] Toaster#0403
ok lul

[15] GoldenPot8o#2294
I’m gonna come over, I WOULD HEAVILY PREFER IF SATCHEL CAME TOO, and I would also like it if WE DIDNT BIKE, but it’s really not helpful when I’m making a decision if one crucial person isn’t giving straight answers

[15] Toaster#0403
is that person me

[15] Toaster#0403
because we biking 100%

[15] Toaster#0403

[15] Toaster#0403

[15] Toaster#0403
well wait if ur gonna come but

[15] GoldenPot8o#2294
Could have figured this out way faster if a) you shut the fuck up when I’m typing, and b) if you answered immediately when I asked questions

[15] Toaster#0403
wot

[15] Toaster#0403
wtv

[15] Toaster#0403
we biking

[15] Toaster#0403
we goin

[15] 5a+ch31.exe#9554
Where would we go if I did go?

[15] 5a+ch31.exe#9554
Trails, that is

[15] Toaster#0403
you know the trail at the horse stables

[15] Toaster#0403
goes out to the end of the mesa

[15] 5a+ch31.exe#9554
No

[15] Toaster#0403
oh

[15] Toaster#0403
its really easy we go on a dirt road beside the actual trail and its like flat the entire time

[15] 5a+ch31.exe#9554
Iv never been mountain biking

[15] 5a+ch31.exe#9554
Ok

[15] Toaster#0403
we can obv go slow if someone gets really tired or something but its a pretty easy trail

[15] Toaster#0403
going back is the hard part because its all *very slightly* uphill

[15] Toaster#0403
but that means that going out its all really ez

[15] 5a+ch31.exe#9554
Ya, I'll go

[15] 5a+ch31.exe#9554
Give me a few minutes

[15] Toaster#0403

[15] Zildin#0532
also jonk which was the one you have

[15] JONKKKK#4186
oculus rift

[15] Zildin#0532
i’m intending to acquire one

[15] JONKKKK#4186
yeah you wouldnt like it tho

[15] Zildin#0532
wires?

[15] JONKKKK#4186
you would probably want the quest

[15] JONKKKK#4186
wires + cameras

[15] Zildin#0532
how bad are the wires

[15] JONKKKK#4186
pretty bad

[15] JONKKKK#4186
well

[15] Zildin#0532
oh oof

[15] JONKKKK#4186
not really

[15] Toaster#0403
get steams one

[15] Zildin#0532
?

[15] Zildin#0532
They have one?

[15] JONKKKK#4186
those ones have cameras and he doesnt want them

[15] JONKKKK#4186
yeah the valve ones

[15] Zildin#0532
yeah i don’t have room

[15] Toaster#0403
wdym what

[15] JONKKKK#4186
rift s needs no sensors

[15] Zildin#0532
i don’t have a lot of room

[15] Toaster#0403
steam vr has camera

[15] Toaster#0403
?

[15] Toaster#0403
ah ok

[15] JONKKKK#4186
yeah

[15] Zildin#0532
like unless it’s this tiny thing then i probably can’t

[15] Zildin#0532
so oculus quest?

[15] Toaster#0403
quest doesnt have cams rite

[15] Toaster#0403
yh

[15] JONKKKK#4186
yeah

[15] Toaster#0403
but it 500 bucc

[15] JONKKKK#4186
and no comp needed

[15] Zildin#0532
oh

[15] Zildin#0532
that’s not too much

[15] Zildin#0532
i think

[15] JONKKKK#4186
yeah quest only has oculus games

[15] JONKKKK#4186
i would reccomend the rift s

[15] Zildin#0532
ok

[15] Zildin#0532
can it do steam and stuff

[15] JONKKKK#4186
yea

[15] Zildin#0532
also how the fuck do i find vr games, especially for a wireless one

[15] JONKKKK#4186
on the vr store

[15] JONKKKK#4186
its an app on the system itself i think?

[15] JONKKKK#4186
idk

[15] Toaster#0403
steam -> store -> vr

[15] JONKKKK#4186
no on the quest

[15] Zildin#0532
oh nice

[15] Toaster#0403
oh quest cant do steam games

[15] Zildin#0532
oh oof

[15] Toaster#0403
for fucking 500 bucks?

[15] JONKKKK#4186
i mean

[15] JONKKKK#4186
you can take it anywhere

[15] JONKKKK#4186
also

[15] Zildin#0532
beat saber and stuff is on steam tho right

[15] JONKKKK#4186
if you dont have a computer to run vr 500 bucks is good

[15] Toaster#0403
sure but if youre looking for vr why dont you already have a good pc

[15] Zildin#0532
I have parts ordered

[15] JONKKKK#4186
yeah connors gonna upgrade his

[15] Zildin#0532
i spent like 1k lol

[15] Toaster#0403
yeah lul

[15] Toaster#0403
if youre looking at VR then you should def have a good comp

[15] Zildin#0532
i mean like it’s gonna have more then 4 gb of ram

[15] Toaster#0403
id much rather have gamer comp than vr

[15] Toaster#0403
4gb is probably below average nowadays

[15] Zildin#0532
yeah lol

[15] Toaster#0403
id bet 8 is average overall but 16 is average for gaming

[15] Zildin#0532
but it’s what i’m working with rn

[15] Toaster#0403
32-64 is probably average for like editing and streaming comps

[15] Zildin#0532
is 16 good for vr?

[15] Toaster#0403
1024+ is like supercomp

[15] Toaster#0403
16 probably fine for vr

[15] Zildin#0532
ok

[15] Toaster#0403
as long as you dont plan or recording or streaming it lul

[15] JONKKKK#4186
yeah thats what i have

[15] Zildin#0532
oh god no

[15] Zildin#0532
why would i want to make myself look stupid online? i already do that in person

[15] Toaster#0403
gg

[15] Zildin#0532
ok so ye

[15] Zildin#0532
but yeah i’ll actually be able to do stuff when it’s done

[15] Toaster#0403
gg

[15] Toaster#0403
yeah id only want vr if like everyone who we play with in our friend group also had it cuz singleplayer games are fun for a bit but im not gonna get a 400 dollar accesory to get bored after a week

[15] Zildin#0532
makes sense

[15] JONKKKK#4186
(thats why i want you to get vr)

[15] Zildin#0532
oh shit is multiplayer beat saber a thing

[15] JONKKKK#4186
nah dont think so

[15] Zildin#0532
oh rip

[15] Toaster#0403
honestly id probably just not get vr because jonathan never wants to play what i wanna play anyways and probably wouldnt want to do shit in vr with me either soooooooooooooo

[15] Toaster#0403
still a big yike

[15] Zildin#0532
that’d be neat tho

[15] JONKKKK#4186
echo arena is REALLY good if you want good multiplayer games

[15] Zildin#0532
?

[15] Toaster#0403
yeah except no tho

[15] Toaster#0403
oh you were talking to connor

[15] Toaster#0403
continue

[15] JONKKKK#4186
its free with a 10$ dlc

[15] Zildin#0532
but like. what is it

[15] JONKKKK#4186
its ultimate frisbee in space pretty much

[15] Toaster#0403
0 grav frisbee

[15] Zildin#0532
*oh*

[15] JONKKKK#4186
but the dlc is a shooter

[15] Zildin#0532
like a gun?

[15] Toaster#0403
yes

[15] JONKKKK#4186
yeah

[15] JONKKKK#4186
gun game

[15] JONKKKK#4186
in 0 g

[15] Zildin#0532
does t shoot frisbees or bullets

[15] JONKKKK#4186
l a z e r

[15] Toaster#0403
yeah still a no from me dawg

[15] Zildin#0532
so i can murder people mid frisbee game

[15] Toaster#0403
no

[15] Zildin#0532
oh rip

[15] JONKKKK#4186
no theyre 2 modes

[15] Toaster#0403
its a seperate gamemode

[15] Zildin#0532
ah

[15] Zildin#0532
ok so rift s right

[15] JONKKKK#4186
yeah

[15] Zildin#0532
ok

[15] Zildin#0532
i’ll look into it

[15] Zildin#0532
also i really want try vr minecraft for some reason

[15] Toaster#0403
yeah if i ever got vr id wanna do like

[15] Toaster#0403
vr mc and ttt

[15] Zildin#0532
ttt?

[15] Toaster#0403
trouble in terrorist town

[15] JONKKKK#4186
i think there are actually clientside mods for vr minecraft

[15] Zildin#0532
excuse me what

[15] Zildin#0532
what is this toaster

[15] JONKKKK#4186
doesnt seem that fun to me

[15] JONKKKK#4186
i mean

[15] JONKKKK#4186
it doesnt seem much more fun than echo combat

[15] Toaster#0403
if there are 4 ppl
1 person is traitor (trying to kill everyone)
2 ppl are civilians (trying to survive)
1 person is detective (trying to find and kill traitor)

[15] Toaster#0403
itd be rly fun prolly

[15] Zildin#0532
oh nice

[15] Zildin#0532
that sounds neat

[15] Toaster#0403
but

[15] Toaster#0403
as i said earlier

[15] JONKKKK#4186
oh thats more than i thought it was

[15] Toaster#0403
and as evidenced here

[15] Toaster#0403
jonathan would not want to

[15] JONKKKK#4186
oh i was thinking of oitc

[15] Toaster#0403
its just otc but no

[15] Toaster#0403
thatd be pp

[15] JONKKKK#4186
yeah

[15] Toaster#0403
although imagine mc minigames in vr

[15] JONKKKK#4186
thats why i thought it would be pee pee

[15] Zildin#0532
i’d be down if i ever get this

[15] Zildin#0532
oh god

[15] Toaster#0403
skywars vr

[15] Zildin#0532
not the mini games

[15] JONKKKK#4186
yeah i kinda wanna try that now

[15] Zildin#0532
dragon escape

[15] Zildin#0532
tnt run

[15] JONKKKK#4186
but idk if it would be allowed on most servers

[15] JONKKKK#4186
they usually ban clientside mods

[15] Toaster#0403
thats a fact

[15] Zildin#0532
maybe like dedicated vr servers

[15] Zildin#0532
thosed be nice

[15] JONKKKK#4186
do those exist?

[15] Toaster#0403
some1 could join without vr and just wreck every1

[15] JONKKKK#4186
eh

[15] JONKKKK#4186
not much of a difference

[15] Toaster#0403
uh

[15] Zildin#0532
is vr mc a mod or its own thing

[15] JONKKKK#4186
theres a dedicated vr app but its bedrock

[15] Toaster#0403
isnt either bedrock edition which is PEEPEE GROSS or a mod

[15] Zildin#0532
ok

[15] Toaster#0403
yeah doing that csgo ripoff wtv its called would be fun in vr

[15] Toaster#0403
pretty sure thats what ttt is in its like a mod for it

[15] Toaster#0403
or a gamemode at least

[15] Toaster#0403
pavlov

[15] Zildin#0532
honestly yeah i’d be way more into cs:go in vr then i am the normal@game rn

[15] JONKKKK#4186
i mean you keep saying vr shooters would be fun

[15] JONKKKK#4186
but then you diss the vr shooter i like

[15] Toaster#0403
yeah because 0 grav just takes away from it imo

[15] Toaster#0403
0 grav makes it worse

[15] Zildin#0532
i’d be down for that

[15] Zildin#0532
if i ever get this that is

[15] Toaster#0403
its not like ima get it anytime soon so

[15] Zildin#0532
ok

[15] Zildin#0532
but yeah if we do vr minecraft i’m gonna probably be a nerd and punch at the blocks instead of clicking

[15] Toaster#0403
thats still the thing for me is like vr would probably be fun but its be *better* if walking wasnt just clicking a button to teleport

[15] Toaster#0403
like even just that takes away so much to me

[15] Toaster#0403
360 degree treadmill pls

[15] Zildin#0532
i mean id like that but space

[15] Zildin#0532
also that’d be pricey

[15] JONKKKK#4186
"and though he was my stepfather, I always thought of him as Daddy."

[16] Zildin#0532
ok so i looked into the rift s it looks nice

[16] Zildin#0532
the wire shoudlnt be super bad

[16] JONKKKK#4186
if not there are accessories to get rid of it but it takes a lot of processing power pretty sure

[16] Toaster#0403
jok

[16] Toaster#0403
u shoudl joen

[16] Zildin#0532
i have an AMD Ryzen 5

[16] Zildin#0532

[17] Zildin#0532
oh look its a person

[17] Ban the Juggie fan#6835

[17] Zildin#0532

[17] Zildin#0532
or is the rift s easy to move

[17] JONKKKK#4186

[17] JONKKKK#4186
there are a bunch of wires

[17] Zildin#0532
what about the rift s

[17] JONKKKK#4186
idk

[17] Zildin#0532
it looks like one wire

[17] JONKKKK#4186
yeah that might be easier

**SCP-106 HAS BREACHED CONTAINMENT**

The facility where SCP-107-A is located is also equipped with security measures in place to prevent any unauthorized personnel from entering the room where SCP-107-A has been contained in. It has been found that SCP-107-A's presence inside SCP-106-A has had no discernible impact on containment efforts despite the presence of the anomaly inside of it causing several instances of SCP-106-B to enter through other portions of the facility. Several occasions have occurred since July 22, 2017, where an instance of SCP-106-B from containment within a containment chamber had been encountered as well.

Addendum 107-01: Incident Log 107-00

On July 22, 2017, at 10:33am, multiple security personnel within the Containment Chamber were called upon to investigate the containment breach of SCP-106-A. Once the chamber was searched, SCP-106-A was discovered to have breached containment around it, and SCP-106-A had begun to feed off its fellow anomalies and was now at a critical stage within its

SCP-106 HAS BREACHED CONTAINMENT

This containment was breached at 8:34 pm on October 13, 2017. A total of 12 subjects were exposed to SCP-106 and were able to escape (5 of the 12 returned to Foundation custody and one (2). One subject was discovered in a containment cell, but no other exposure has been found. The other one was observed and recorded by security personnel at Site-17, where a security camera detected a flash of light and multiple flashbulbs, which was apparently directed at the subject by SCP-106. A Foundation researcher was able to analyze the content of the video, and was able to determine what kind of weapon had been aimed at SCP-106, which was an air rifle.

**SCP-173** (SCP-173-7; see Addendum 173-1) is the name of a single, unique individual who is located on a remote corner of the planet Earth. Although SCP-173 is usually perceived as "ancient", researchers have found that it is more analogous to a computer memory than a historical figure. It is the current whereabouts of SCP-173-A. During its time at Site ██, SCP-173-A took on a persona of SCP-1793, an old man with a voice very similar to ███████'s. SCP-173-A occasionally used a variation of SCP-173-A's name. Its most recent persona was originally named "Mister ██" , since that was his last name at the time of his death.

SCP-173-A is believed to be a manifestation of [DATA EXPUNGED].

Description: SCP-173 is not one entity. Instead, it is a series of entities connected by a network of physical interfaces through which information can flow between the networks.

Item #: SCP-001

Object Class: Euclid

Special Containment Procedures: SCP-001 is to be kept in an office located in the Foundation headquarters complex in ███████, New Mexico.

Description: SCP-001 is a ███████-themed collectible card game and was designed for the PC by D. Echternach for his father J. P. Echternach before its release in [DATA EXPUNGED]. SCP-001 is a single-player, one-handed, single player computer game that features a card deck layout using ███████-themed symbols and text, as well as a large number of special card effects, most of which are unknown at this time.

Although the card layout is standard [DATA EXPUNGED], the card effects have not been made public. No information on ███████ and its designer has been officially revealed, and no published documentation regarding the game has been found.

All known cards have been marked with

**Remember kids, when a stranger walks up to you,** you have to stop and ask them to leave — you never can tell when a stranger will have a gun. They usually do, and when you point out to them what's going on in a situation, they won't even bother to listen, instead pointing a gun at your head.

That's why we must take to heart the lesson of the Lord's Prayer. It's really pretty simple. After all, if you don't stop them — especially right before you open your mouth — they will know exactly who was to attack them. And that, kids, is why the Lord spoke the words.

It's the only prayer we can trust, since the Lord uses it when he makes a judgment. Let's pray it before we point a gun at someone.

The words are so easy, you might want to learn them from a Bible. To help you hear them, here's the Bible's English translation:

Jesus said to them, "In the days of Noah, when the ark arched the flood, how was all that ark

**Remember kids, when a stranger walks up to you,** look their way and make eye contact (no more than 90 degrees, with the right eye) and if they don't immediately respond with "yes", don't act like you're giving them the cold shoulder and continue talking. They probably don't know you're talking to them, do they?

8. Always ask if your conversation partner knows you're dating. It doesn't matter if your partner is married, single or married with kids.

9. Ask why your partner is telling you their secrets, and not tell that to a stranger.

10. Don't ever let your curiosity get the best of you.

11. If you hear the word "hope" spoken about your relationship, shut up.

12. Don't expect your partner to be your girlfriend or wife or husband in the same way that you do.

13. Your relationship should be about you and your two people who love each other.

14. Do not treat your partner that way.

**SCP-055** is located in the corner of the room. In the chamber are 3 smaller crates and an empty space.

It is in this space where a group of SCP-055's are to be discovered. The group consists of 2 adult SCP-055's, 1 male and 1 female. It's said that SCP-055's had been living here for over a hundred years and it is this time at night that the group congregates and begins to search for SCP-055. SCP-055's are capable of speech and if spoken to, will show signs of distress due to extreme loneliness and isolation.

SCP-055's were discovered in this cell by a researcher known as Dr. ███████. It was discovered that he was unable to contact SCP-055's and therefore no further attempt to communicate with them was made.

Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-2477-1 and SCP-2477-2 are to be stored in an empty plastic cell, with an air and water supply. The room in which they are kept is to be monitored for signs of movement and any anomalous activity. Any personnel encountered are to be treated as an SCP-2477-2 instance and are to be confined to the same confinement chamber.

Description: SCP-2477-1 is the standard humanoid type found amongst the species. On the inside of its lower limbs it is described as resembling a human male with a thin, yellowish-green skin tone. SCP-2477-1 is generally described as "cute" and "petite". It is usually found with one knee and its torso protruding from it, with a small yellowish patch on SCP-2477-1's back. SCP-2477-1 is capable of communicating with people via "telepathy" by emitting a blue-green light that is visible through objects nearby.

[7:57 AM] Bipen: So I doubt that's what's going on here
[8:11 AM] Jonk: it's probably what you feel during REM sleep, like when people have vivid dreams
[8:11 AM] Jonk: and the nightmares that go with it
[8:21 AM] Serendipity: Sleep paralysis? what are you talking about?

[22] GoldenPot8o#2294
Any percent is a debate between beat the high school levels, beating the college levels, and maxing out the job skill tree.

[22] Toaster#0403
imo any% and death% for life are the same thing

[22] Toaster#0403
theres highschool% and college%, job% etc but

[22] GoldenPot8o#2294
Achievement runs are really tough.

[22] Toaster#0403
you get the credits by dying so any% = death%

That’s why death% and any% are different if you’re stillborn, that’s a bug and thus it doesn’t play the credits.

[19] JONKKKK#4186

[19] Toaster#0403
i wouldnt be too concerned about it if i had confidence that were not all gonna just stop enjoying it once we get far enough

[19] Toaster#0403
if i knew 100% that wed keep playing and having fun all together then it wouldnt really matter but when you have almost a time limit until people start getting bored its just fomo x 10

[19] Toaster#0403
like having a community would be great b

[19] Toaster#0403
ut i meant like 10-30 people and thats not gonna happen anytime soon

[19] GoldenPot8o#2294

[22] Speguni#3116
Have you ever noticed that when two teams are playing a basketball, and one team scores more points than the other, The team that scored the most points always wins?

[22] Speguni#3116
Kind of a weird trend I discovered while praying

[22] Speguni#3116
Would love to know what you all think of this wacky discovery or if anyone is able to offer up an explanation

[22] Zildin#0532
what

[22] GoldenPot8o#2294
its actualy a societal hangover from when the bougousie was in control, those who had the more money, or in this case, points were able to control whatever, and thus would win at society

[22] Speguni#3116
Huh that explains a little bit but how could this be transferred to basketball? Players don't score money they score points which, for some odd reason, make a certain team win. It just doesn't add up

[22] Tarnished_Star#8193
huh

[22] Tarnished_Star#8193
interesting

[22] Tarnished_Star#8193
i'll have to look into this one

[21] Toaster#0403

[21] Toaster#0403
if you have a low bitrate then it breaks at tesla gates but

[21] Toaster#0403
it only did it for me bcuz i had my bitrate at 2500

[21] GoldenPot8o#2294

if were bein honest then im like chaotic neutral
nates lawful evil
quinns neutral evil
jonathans chaotic good

[15] Toaster#0403
going off of descriptions of each one

[15] Toaster#0403
thats the most accurate

[15] GoldenPot8o#2294
you dont understand how this works

[15] JONKKKK#4186
im either chaotic good or lawful good

[15] Toaster#0403
youre chaotic good

[15] JONKKKK#4186
explain

[15] Toaster#0403
chaotic good is like they do what they want (usually kind and benevolent) but they dont care about what other people think of them and do things that may not agree with society

[15] Toaster#0403
we live in a society

[15] GoldenPot8o#2294
on the dnd server we do things like this, and im working on an extended alignment chart because of it

[15] JONKKKK#4186
ooo what would it be?

[15] Toaster#0403
my judgements are accurate

[15] Toaster#0403
and you cant change my mind

[15] JONKKKK#4186
i dont think quinn is neutral evil

[15] JONKKKK#4186
hes not mean or anything

[15] Toaster#0403
neutral evil is like "ill do whatever i can get away with"

[15] JONKKKK#4186
ehh

[15] Toaster#0403
no regard for laws

[15] Toaster#0403
and uhhhhhhh

[16] HollowRisk#0001
owo

[16] GoldenPot8o#2294
ok its for official game servers

[16] Toaster#0403
but how do you add em

[16] GoldenPot8o#2294
the channel has to look like this
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/539106814697013250/616766039698702346/unknown.png

[16] Toaster#0403

[16] Toaster#0403
what

[16] Toaster#0403
OH FOUND IT

[16] Toaster#0403
that was kinda a bad explanation of how that works

[16] JONKKKK#4186
how do you do it?

[16] Toaster#0403
find a channel like that from an official game server and down where youd normally send messages it says follow

[16] Toaster#0403
MINECRAFT #game-announcements

[16] JONKKKK#4186
wait so how does it work

[16] Toaster#0403
CallMeCarson Discord Cult #announcements

[16] JONKKKK#4186
also you should add those to #announcements

[16] Toaster#0403
meh #announcements is like OUR announcements

[16] Toaster#0403
if you can call them announcements

[16] Toaster#0403
i like the idea of them being in general

[16] JONKKKK#4186
you should make a new channel so i can mute it

[16] JONKKKK#4186
/s

[16] JONKKKK#4186
(but only a little)

[16] Toaster#0403
damn SCPU doesnt have their announcements channel set to an announcements channel

[16] Toaster#0403
so i cant add it

[16] Toaster#0403
broooooooooooo carson went on vsauce2's podcast bro

[16] Toaster#0403
oh yeah gamers the devs of SCPU said they might add like a coop mode

[16] Toaster#0403
almost 100% they wont add online like in SCPSL but like 2 player coop is a pretty big possibility

I know Satchel’s the only one that plays magic, but basically, this combo gives me 1 spicy point for every dude I have on the field, then Swahili can duplicate the amount of dudes I have, and then I can use all my new spicy points and convert it to damage that the red boi does, obliterating everything.

[09] GoldenPot8o#2294

[09] JONKKKK#4186

[09] GoldenPot8o#2294
artifact that makes clue tokens, and you can cash in 3 clues to search your library for any card and put it in your hand

[09] JONKKKK#4186

[09] GoldenPot8o#2294

1) bowsa
2) whatever the fuck I just posted

[13] JONKKKK#4186
would it be in the background?

[13] JONKKKK#4186
because bg songs shouldnt have lyrics imo

[13] GoldenPot8o#2294
It would be synced to

[13] JONKKKK#4186
what would it be synced to? like an edit or a funny or...

[13] GoldenPot8o#2294
Probably a gungeon edit

[13] JONKKKK#4186
oh ok

[13] JONKKKK#4186
i still like #1

[13] Toaster#0403
a gungeon *edit*? like the dumb thing i made of jonathan kinda edit?

[13] JONKKKK#4186
like csgo edit i assume

[13] Toaster#0403
thats what i meant but ok

[13] GoldenPot8o#2294
Yeah like a csgo edit but it’s not cs so I can meme the shit out of it

[13] Toaster#0403
uh

[13] Toaster#0403

[13] Toaster#0403
i must say that you can do whatever you want but starting out editing with an edit (ik sounds stupid but u get what im sayin) is probably not a good idea

[13] Toaster#0403

[19] Alterae#0258

[19] HollowRisk#0001
Google chrome og browser

[16] SauronBSMC#3972
ok. now. give me the reason why i should not use it?

[16] SauronBSMC#3972
give me a very very good and valid reason

[16] Toaster#0403
because you cant play on the server if you do

[16] SauronBSMC#3972
and i'll remove it when playing on your server

[16] SauronBSMC#3972
^ That's not a good and valid reason

[16] Toaster#0403

ah. i see. you think i'm cheating? cheater

[16] Toaster#0403

[16] JONKKKK#4186
why *shouldn't* you?

[16] Toaster#0403
because you cannot play on the server with it

[16] SauronBSMC#3972
you still did not give a valid reason

[16] Toaster#0403
if you want to play on the server

[16] Toaster#0403
you cannot use it

[16] Toaster#0403
because it is the rule

[16] Toaster#0403
who cares why the rule is there

[16] Toaster#0403
it is a rule

[16] Toaster#0403
if you do not follow it

[16] Toaster#0403
you cannot play

[16] SauronBSMC#3972

[17] SauronBSMC#3972
well. gun laws are not the problem in the school shooting scenario. Bullying is..

[17] Alterae#0258
Ueropean Enion.

[17] Toaster#0403
i feel like its kinda both

[17] Alterae#0258
Gun laws *and* bullying.

[17] Toaster#0403
kinda just overall shit

[17] Alterae#0258
They have bullying all over.

[17] SauronBSMC#3972
yeah, it's everywhere. even EU

[17] Alterae#0258
But the shit schools and radicalization from social media make it worse.

[17] Alterae#0258
And then said radicalized wanker gets a gun.

[17] Toaster#0403
americas both like "oh this person has a mental illness that we didnt check or notice at all because we dont pay attention to our students whatsoever? lets give him a gun its fine"

[17] Alterae#0258
And some poor schmuk in a math class learns that bullet+body=bad

[17] Alterae#0258
actually a lot of mass shooters *aren't* diagnosed with any kind of mental illness

[17] HollowRisk#0001
Americanism

[17] Toaster#0403
sure but they dont check for it when you buy a gun

[17] HollowRisk#0001
They do?

[17] SauronBSMC#3972
they don't check anything as far as i got to know

[17] SauronBSMC#3972
might be wrong

[17] HollowRisk#0001
Most shooters are under 18 and buy their gun illegally

[17] HollowRisk#0001
School^

[17] Toaster#0403
sure but that still just shows how easy it is to a q u i r e f i r e p o w e r

[17] SauronBSMC#3972
all i know is that you go to texas, you go to a gun shop, and get a gun just like that

[17] Alterae#0258
or steal from parents

[17] HollowRisk#0001
You can’t get a handgun under 21 in any state

[17] SauronBSMC#3972
That is where gun-laws come in.

[17] SauronBSMC#3972
The only stricting that would make sense would be a requirement to lock guns in safes. not just let them lie around.

[17] Alterae#0258
i mean maybe

[17] HollowRisk#0001
Eh

[17] Alterae#0258
but anyone can open a safe if they know the combo

[17] HollowRisk#0001
My phone finna die lol

[17] Toaster#0403
gg

[17] SauronBSMC#3972
that is where bullying part comes in.

[17] HollowRisk#0001
gg ez no re

[17] SauronBSMC#3972
Most shootings are started by bullying

[17] Toaster#0403
yes we all agree

[17] Toaster#0403
its just not *only* bullying

[17] Toaster#0403
being mean to someone isnt gonna make then shoot up a school

[17] Toaster#0403
but its a factor

[17] Alterae#0258
yup

[17] Alterae#0258
people are dickwads and they should be less dickwadish..

[17] JONKKKK#4186
i know why theres so many shootings

[17] HollowRisk#0001
Some are just outright anger, frustration, and emotions

[17] MEE6#4876
You talk too much, @HollowRisk. You just advanced to level 9.

[17] JONKKKK#4186

[17] Toaster#0403

[17] Toaster#0403
yes

[17] HollowRisk#0001
We don’t

[17] Toaster#0403
well not where we live but

[17] SauronBSMC#3972
i believe you can buy firearms there

[17] Toaster#0403
in the us in general yes

[17] HollowRisk#0001
Yeah I was just at a Walmart

[17] JONKKKK#4186
Pinned a message.

[17] HollowRisk#0001
We walked by the station

[17] HollowRisk#0001
I got Mario loaded up and I’m ready to go

[17] SauronBSMC#3972
i don't know if the weapons in walmart are just airguns, or normal firearms (9mm, .22LR, .45ACP etc)

[17] HollowRisk#0001
Normal firearms

[17] HollowRisk#0001
Most are just hunting rifles tho

[17] SauronBSMC#3972
i only saw  airguns on website lol

[17] HollowRisk#0001
You need to goto a gun store if you what ar-15s and the like

[17] SauronBSMC#3972
yeah, i know that.

[17] HollowRisk#0001
I was just there and I can confirm that they where firearms

[17] HollowRisk#0001
They had scopes aswell

[17] Toaster#0403
can you get guns online?

[17] HollowRisk#0001
No

[17] HollowRisk#0001
Only dark web

[17] Toaster#0403
wouldnt that have to be like dark web? yeah ok

[17] SauronBSMC#3972
in sweden you need to take an hunter's exam just to get started on a license.

[17] SauronBSMC#3972
you need approved safe etc.

[17] HollowRisk#0001
You need to take a test to hunt with a gun

[17] SauronBSMC#3972
however, airguns are totally legal as long as they don't exceed 10J

[17] HollowRisk#0001
But to buy one is only an age requirement I’m pretty sure

[17] SauronBSMC#3972
yes

[17] SauronBSMC#3972
18+

[17] HollowRisk#0001
You Swedish?

[17] SauronBSMC#3972

eh its not that bad

you can react to your own command to draw it

[19] Toaster#0403
i had to leave for dessert btw thats why i was gone

[19] Toaster#0403
but you can draw your own command, just cant draw twice in a row

[19] JONKKKK#4186
?

[19] JONKKKK#4186
you should be able to draw twice in a row imo

[19] JONKKKK#4186
thats just me tho

[19] Toaster#0403
meh i think its better if it switches

[19] Toaster#0403
but we could do you can do multiple times

[19] Toaster#0403
we could just have a limit like

[19] Toaster#0403
you cant draw more than 4 times in a row

[19] JONKKKK#4186
also i dont think you should be able to draw your own command

[19] Toaster#0403
what

[19] Toaster#0403
bruh

[19] Toaster#0403
im willing to change not being able to draw twice in a row but like

[19] JONKKKK#4186
alright ok

[19] Toaster#0403
right now, if you cant draw your own command, ill just draw infinitely until some other person eventually notices the new channel

[19] JONKKKK#4186
tru

[19] Toaster#0403
see ok

[19] Toaster#0403
heres something

[19] JONKKKK#4186
maybe you should be able to command after you drew?

[19] Toaster#0403
so you can draw your own command, you can draw as many times in a row as you want, but can you make a command after you drew

[19] Toaster#0403
yeah

[19] JONKKKK#4186
and not draw your own command?

[19] Toaster#0403
meh

[19] Toaster#0403
i think it should be

[19] Toaster#0403
you can do a command after your own drawing, but you cant draw that command

[19] Toaster#0403
but if you do a command on someone elses drawing, you can draw it

[19] JONKKKK#4186
yeah yeah

[19] JONKKKK#4186
so you cant go 3 times in a row

[19] Toaster#0403
ok

[19] Toaster#0403
yeah

[19] Alterae#0258

i was just trying to have a good time
but you came along
and decimated that plan.
you destroyed my life.
you annihilated my hopes
and eradicated my dreams.
i will obliterate your skeleton
and grind it to a pulp
then mix the pulp with water
and drink it.
so,
from the bottom of my heart,
fuck you.

[12] Jacob._.#5479

[12] JONKKKK#4186
it was lagging a lot so he switched it to his home computer

[12] Jacob._.#5479

[12] SauronBSMC#3972

[12] JONKKKK#4186

[12] SauronBSMC#3972
*have to add it again to my serverlist

[12] Jacob._.#5479

[12] JONKKKK#4186
i dont think his server is on 1.7...

[12] SauronBSMC#3972
ikr

[12] SauronBSMC#3972
i couldn't join his server with that even if i wanted to

[12] SauronBSMC#3972
3 reasons:
- I don't have the new ip.
- Old ip is off
- The server isn't 1.7.10

[12] SauronBSMC#3972
and no. i'm not streaming yet lol

[12] Alterae#0258
Why the fuck would you play 1.7?

[12] SauronBSMC#3972
Tekkit legends is 1.7.10

[12] JONKKKK#4186
almost every mod is compatible with 1.7

[12] SauronBSMC#3972
nothing i can do about it sadly (the version of tekkit)

[12] SauronBSMC#3972

I'm not gay. I am not gay. Do not fucking call me gay ever again. I am quite honestly one of the least gay people you have ever met. I fuck bitches, mad fucking fucked bitches. I am not gay. I am not gay. Stop saying I am gay. If you were a girl, I would have probably already fucked the shit out of you by now, but unfortunately you are an ugly fucking GUY whose tight bussy will remained un-stretched by my fat, meaty, nine inch cock because I AM NOT GAY. If I was gay though, you would find my Jackhammer pounding your tight little bussy with the force of ten tsunamis. Luckily for you, I am NOT GAY, and you will have your virgin asshole remain unpounded ad infinitum. Actually, it seems to me like you are the gay one here. You are gay, not me. I am not gay, and I will never be. If I was ever gay in a past life (which I WASN'T), I would be killing myself right now, that is how gay I AM NOT.

[22] Serendipity#3758
Understand

;;-;;

[22] GoldenPot8o#2294
¯\_(ツ)_/¯

[22] GoldenPot8o#2294
i know it intuitively

[22] GoldenPot8o#2294
but i cant teach it

[22] Serendipity#3758
Guess

[22] Serendipity#3758
I'll

[22] Serendipity#3758
Just

[22] GoldenPot8o#2294
ded

[22] Serendipity#3758
Take the L

[22] Serendipity#3758
It's fine

[22] Chalkbot#5826
I know it

[22] Chalkbot#5826
One sec

[22] Serendipity#3758
Actually?

[22] Chalkbot#5826
(10.5,1.5)

[22] Serendipity#3758
But like

[22] Serendipity#3758
How

[22] Chalkbot#5826
Ok

[22] Chalkbot#5826
So

[22] Serendipity#3758
Also I'm more confused with the first two

[22] Chalkbot#5826
(9,3)

[22] Chalkbot#5826
Oh

[22] Serendipity#3758
But do continue

[22] Chalkbot#5826
9

[22] Chalkbot#5826
3

[22] Chalkbot#5826
One sec

[22] Chalkbot#5826
4.5

[22] Serendipity#3758
ok

[22] Chalkbot#5826
The length for number 2 is exactly 9.486832980505138 but could also be made as ✔90

[22] Serendipity#3758
Woaj

[22] Serendipity#3758
how'd you

[22] Chalkbot#5826
Ok

[22] Chalkbot#5826
So you know the pythagorean theorem

[22] GoldenPot8o#2294
xavier big brian

[22] Serendipity#3758
Yea

[22] Chalkbot#5826
Ok

[22] Chalkbot#5826
So I look at it as a triangle

[22] Chalkbot#5826
High 3 base 9

[22] Chalkbot#5826
So I did 9^2 + 3^2 = 90

[22] Chalkbot#5826
(81) + (9) = 90

[22] Serendipity#3758
That makes a little more sense

[22] Chalkbot#5826
So I square rooted that boi

[22] Chalkbot#5826
And got 9.486832980505138

[22] Chalkbot#5826
But that number has the big gay

[22] Serendipity#3758
Lmao

[22] Chalkbot#5826
So write ✔90

[22] Serendipity#3758
√ 90?

[22] Chalkbot#5826
But you could also use the distance formula but that formula also has the big gay

[22] Chalkbot#5826
Yes

[22] Serendipity#3758
Ok

[22] Chalkbot#5826
I’m on mobile so I can type that

[22] Serendipity#3758
What is the distance formula

[22] Serendipity#3758
I just added space between the two

[22] Serendipity#3758
I'm also on mobile

[22] Chalkbot#5826
Some gay ass formula to calculate the distance for the lines

[22] Serendipity#3758
Oh

[22] Chalkbot#5826
Idk the formula because I forgot it

[22] Serendipity#3758
Oop

[22] Chalkbot#5826
So I just use the therom

[22] Chalkbot#5826
Also the formula is dum

[22] Serendipity#3758
Oki

[22] Chalkbot#5826
It’s just as dumb as standard form

[23] GoldenPot8o#2294
I wield a full gross of reaction pics

[20] JONKKKK#4186
idk which one

[20] Zildin#0532
fuc

[21] Zildin#0532
yo what was the thing that makes .jar files work

[21] Toaster#0403
literally just google search "jar file fix"

[21] Zildin#0532
oh so java never installed

[21] Zildin#0532
that makes sense

[21] Zildin#0532
its big brain time

[21] Zildin#0532
fun its still not working

[21] Zildin#0532
ok i just needed jarfix

[07] Vlalkosei#3238
hey jonk what software are you guys using to host a sevtech server

[08] Toaster#0403
why does everyone keep asking jonathan about hosting and such

[08] Toaster#0403
i am the one who hosts all the servers and the one who knows stuff like ips

[08] Toaster#0403
just sayin

[08] Toaster#0403
jonathans tried to host a server like twice and i dont think its worked either time

[08] Toaster#0403
maybe one of them worked?

[08] Vlalkosei#3238
ok, sorry i didnt know who was hosting and jonathan was a safe bet

[08] Toaster#0403
connor just also asked jonathan about sevtech (i dont even remember what it was but it was something that i could answer and jonathan could not) so since you just asked him like connor did i just wanted to say "bruh"

[08] Toaster#0403
and ot answer your question, we arent using any software (well probably not what youre thinking of at least)

[08] Toaster#0403
this is the server
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/539106814697013250/620270568360640512/unknown.png

[10] Zildin#0532
i was asking for the non-modded server and i was wondering about hosting because i was attempting to play sky factory with a friend

[10] Toaster#0403
yeah but you asked jonathan about the non-modded one

[10] Toaster#0403
and as i said hes hosted like 2 servers total

[10] Toaster#0403
modded or non modded

[11] Zildin#0532
I just need the ip to the non modded one

[11] Zildin#0532
i dont care about hosting for it

[11] Toaster#0403
yeah its the same ip just a diff port

[11] Zildin#0532
what port

[11] Toaster#0403
but its not up and prolly wont be for a while lul

[11] Toaster#0403

[15] GoldenPot8o#2294
Hmm

[15] GoldenPot8o#2294
I have no clue how I screwed that up so bad

[15] GoldenPot8o#2294
I’m trying to make a quesadilla

[15] GoldenPot8o#2294
And I burnt the shit out of it

[15] GoldenPot8o#2294
i figured it out

[15] GoldenPot8o#2294
there was too much heat for such a small thermal capacity

[15] JONKKKK#4186
so you cooked it too much?

[15] GoldenPot8o#2294
yeah

[15] GoldenPot8o#2294
now that you say it that way

[15] JONKKKK#4186
lol

[15] GoldenPot8o#2294
i dont think in laymans terms

[18] GoldenPot8o#2294
im scared

[18] Toaster#0403
so what im hearing is i got medium skill level and low challenge level

[18] GoldenPot8o#2294
yeah

[18] Toaster#0403
but that doesnt take into account motivation or work ethic

[18] GoldenPot8o#2294
its from this video

[18] GoldenPot8o#2294
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zna9-8RGQro

[18] GoldenPot8o#2294
which is something ive done on accident before

[18] GoldenPot8o#2294
i didnt know it was called flow

[19] GoldenPot8o#2294
i called it the timeless void

[19] Toaster#0403
but it dont take into account motivation

which is like 100% of why i dont do things

[19] Toaster#0403
gaming or not

[19] GoldenPot8o#2294
fair

[19] GoldenPot8o#2294
i dont believe that cart because it implies that i have a medium to high skill level

[19] Toaster#0403
yeah honestly that chart isnt super accurate

[19] Toaster#0403
cuz challenge level differs for different skill levels

if youre low skill lvl, something really easy is a big challenge for you

[19] GoldenPot8o#2294
yeah

[19] Toaster#0403
and if youre high skill level, something thats high challenge would be really fuccin difficult

[19] JONKKKK#4186
wait but what about medium skill level and medium challenge

[19] Zildin#0532
It doesnt exist\

[19] Zildin#0532

[22] Zildin#0532

[22] Zildin#0532

[06] JONKKKK#4186

[06] Toaster#0403
well yes its my layout for the one with the pole in the center but theres no pole in the center because i made it too small

[06] Toaster#0403

i wanna graph more things

[21] HollowRisk#0001
monkas lightning

[22] Toaster#0403
graph idea pls

[22] Toaster#0403
oooooooooooooooo

[22] Toaster#0403
something thatd be interesting but also a bit hard

[22] Toaster#0403
i could graph how many messages are sent at each time of day

[22] HollowRisk#0001
lame

[22] Toaster#0403
but thatd require like
discord -> text
find all the timestamps
sort by hour, probably
one array 0-23
one with the amount of messages sent in that hour

[22] Toaster#0403
then graph the two arrays as x and y

[22] Toaster#0403
probably wouldnt be too bad actually
