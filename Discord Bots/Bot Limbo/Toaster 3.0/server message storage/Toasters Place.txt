**Zildin#0532**: But he did it like a week ago.
**Zildin#0532**: And not much was said in this channel since
**GoldenPot8o#2294**: Seriously Connor
**Zildin#0532**: what
**Zildin#0532**: just kinda confused
**JONKKKK#4186**: hes promoting in <#451214889239838721>
**Zildin#0532**: its like getting tik tok adds
**JONKKKK#4186**: he was streaming
**Zildin#0532**: oh ok
**Zildin#0532**: i thought it was like hey this exists
**GoldenPot8o#2294**: Theres nothing wrong with that you stupid motherfucker
**GoldenPot8o#2294**: Im not stupid
**Zildin#0532**: ?
**JONKKKK#4186**: what
**Zildin#0532**: what did satchel do
**WillCo Gaming#0258**: Yeah.
**GoldenPot8o#2294**: He changed my nickname
**JONKKKK#4186**: oh no
**JONKKKK#4186**: that was me
**GoldenPot8o#2294**: Gay
**Zildin#0532**: yeah how did he change tht
**WillCo Gaming#0258**: So it should be fuck off jonk.
**JONKKKK#4186**: nates
**JONKKKK#4186**: you wanted to play fn to "meme on ppl"
**JONKKKK#4186**: but you were just playing it
**JONKKKK#4186**: unironically
**WillCo Gaming#0258**: so?
**GoldenPot8o#2294**: No no I 100% hate the player base but the game if you get down to it its not that terrible
**JONKKKK#4186**: yeah see?
**JONKKKK#4186**: you like fortnite
**WillCo Gaming#0258**: So?
**Zildin#0532**: oh hey toaster could you invite me to the minecraft realm
**GoldenPot8o#2294**: See but how is the gameplay bad
**JONKKKK#4186**: i mean yeah, its not like its *terrible* but its not *good* either
**GoldenPot8o#2294**: Yeah Im agreeing with you there
**Zildin#0532**: yeah
**JONKKKK#4186**: fortnite takes itself way too seriously
**GoldenPot8o#2294**: No
**JONKKKK#4186**: it should be like mario kart
**GoldenPot8o#2294**: The players take it way too seriously
**Zildin#0532**: yeah lol
**JONKKKK#4186**: where they admit its just a game to screw around with your friends
**JONKKKK#4186**: but no tho
**Zildin#0532**: Seeing clips of kids having a seizure becuase they got banned is pretty fun
**JONKKKK#4186**: and nate the thing is
**GoldenPot8o#2294**: What do you think their game is to them then
**JONKKKK#4186**: with a game like fortnite the game IS the playerbase
**JONKKKK#4186**: because its multiplayer
**JONKKKK#4186**: so you just get a bunch of tryhards
**JONKKKK#4186**: like
**JONKKKK#4186**: yeah, the base game isnt bad
**GoldenPot8o#2294**: Ooh jonk likes fortnite
**GoldenPot8o#2294**: Do you see how dumb you are being
**JONKKKK#4186**: nono but the playerbase is a bunch of sweaty tryhards but also casuals
**JONKKKK#4186**: and its
**JONKKKK#4186**: it ruins the game basically
**JONKKKK#4186**: like
**GoldenPot8o#2294**: Ive literally agreed with you on every point you made
**WillCo Gaming#0258**: What even is this argument?
**JONKKKK#4186**: with mc yeah, the fandom is kinda bad, but its mostly the stigma that its for little kids
**GoldenPot8o#2294**: So by that logic you like fortnite
**JONKKKK#4186**: no
**GoldenPot8o#2294**: Yeah
**JONKKKK#4186**: the game ITSELF isnt bad ***BY ITSELF***
**JONKKKK#4186**: but, (bare with me) its like roblox
**Zildin#0532**: protip: fortnite is better if you dont vc with random people
**JONKKKK#4186**: in roblox, you don't ***have*** to buy a membership but if you don't it sucks
**JONKKKK#4186**: same situation with fortnite and battle passes
**Zildin#0532**: how does it suck without a battle pass?
**Zildin#0532**: its all astethic
**JONKKKK#4186**: you cant buy skins
**WillCo Gaming#0258**: So?
**JONKKKK#4186**: and people know youre a "noob"
**JONKKKK#4186**: so they target you
**JONKKKK#4186**: its like roblox, as i said
**Zildin#0532**: they dont "know" they assume
**WillCo Gaming#0258**: The trick is to pwn them, in that case.
**Zildin#0532**: like actually
**JONKKKK#4186**: yeah but it still gives you an unfair disadvantage
**Zildin#0532**: not rlly
**Zildin#0532**: its just becuase people are assholes
**JONKKKK#4186**: yeah
**JONKKKK#4186**: so it gives you an unfair disadvantage
**Zildin#0532**: and i mean its called get better
**Zildin#0532**: like go places people rarely go
**JONKKKK#4186**: because ***THE PEOPLE DECIDE HOW GOOD THE GAME IS***
**JONKKKK#4186**: yeah but getting better defeats the purpose of it being a game you screw around with your friends in
**GoldenPot8o#2294**: Yeah Im agreeing with you on all of those points. Except maybe the battle pass one. Also yeah you can get skins you just need real money (which you need anyways for most of the skins). Also theres a free always version of the battle pass that gives you dances and stuff still.
**JONKKKK#4186**: do you guys see what i mean!?
**WillCo Gaming#0258**: Not really.
**Zildin#0532**: kinda
**JONKKKK#4186**: so, my main issue is that fortnite is freemium
**GoldenPot8o#2294**: So by the logic of you and I have the same idea of fortnite, you like fortnite too.
**JONKKKK#4186**: uhh
**JONKKKK#4186**: np
**JONKKKK#4186**: its cancerous
**JONKKKK#4186**: like
**GoldenPot8o#2294**: Yeah Im still agreeing
**JONKKKK#4186**: ok nate fuck off
**JONKKKK#4186**: you agreed with everything besides my main point on why its bad
**Zildin#0532**: Basically Fortnite would be a hafl-decent game except the players are assholes. is that right?
**JONKKKK#4186**: fortnite is structured like a mobile game except its filled with sweaty tryhards
**GoldenPot8o#2294**: Your main point was i don want to spend money and I disproved it by saying you dont need to spend money at all
**JONKKKK#4186**: its basically if you took a mobile game and ported it to pc
**JONKKKK#4186**: nate
**JONKKKK#4186**: you don't "need" to buy things in starwars battlefront or whatever it was that ea made
**GoldenPot8o#2294**: Thats cause fucking ***EA*** made it dumb ass
**JONKKKK#4186**: also, can i mention that fortnite took some perfectly good, already existing dances, and claimed them as theirs?
**JONKKKK#4186**: and made them cancerous
**Zildin#0532**: like which?
**JONKKKK#4186**: flossing
**JONKKKK#4186**: it was *fine*
**GoldenPot8o#2294**: Its not fortnites fault that their players think the dances came from their game first
**JONKKKK#4186**: they couldve
**JONKKKK#4186**: not
**JONKKKK#4186**: put those in ther
**Zildin#0532**: but i mean effort
**JONKKKK#4186**: what
**Zildin#0532**: its like it takes an effort
**JONKKKK#4186**: to what
**GoldenPot8o#2294**: This just loops back to your freemium argument
**JONKKKK#4186**: also nate what do you mean
**GoldenPot8o#2294**: Because if they didnt make the dances you wouldnt spend money on emotes like those and then because you arent paying for them its technically free and thats what you want.
**JONKKKK#4186**: yeah
**JONKKKK#4186**: my argument makes coherent sense
**Zildin#0532**: Wait is your main point people assuming noob by skin?
**GoldenPot8o#2294**: Yeah except no because you dont have to spend money regardless
**JONKKKK#4186**: no that fortnite is basically a moblie game ported to bc
**JONKKKK#4186**: yeah but nate
**Zildin#0532**: ehh i guess
**JONKKKK#4186**: then why do people dump hundreds of dollars into fortnite?
**Zildin#0532**: except the opposite is tur
**Zildin#0532**: becuase they want to
**GoldenPot8o#2294**: Because they want to
**GoldenPot8o#2294**: Not because they have to
**JONKKKK#4186**: well first of all
**JONKKKK#4186**: you cant even choose your gender without paying money
**Zildin#0532**: Becuase they want the hip new look and "accidentally" took moms credit card
**Zildin#0532**: and>
**Zildin#0532**: thats whatever
**GoldenPot8o#2294**: Yeah
**GoldenPot8o#2294**: I can sense youre running out of arguments
**JONKKKK#4186**:
**Zildin#0532**: Basically the players of the game doesnt like people who dont put money into a game they dont want to put money in
**Zildin#0532**: either becuase they cant or they dont want to
**JONKKKK#4186**: and also, even if the game itself is actally good i still wouldnt play it
**JONKKKK#4186**: its one of "those" games
**JONKKKK#4186**: like
**JONKKKK#4186**: dota might be good but im staying away because its one of "those" games
**GoldenPot8o#2294**: Yeah half the games we suggest are those games too
**JONKKKK#4186**: there are certain games that people think are bad regardless
**JONKKKK#4186**: thats why we were making fun of you for liking fortnite
**Zildin#0532**: Except im not
**JONKKKK#4186**: because fortnite is one of "those" games
**JONKKKK#4186**: i mean
**JONKKKK#4186**: you can like it all you want
**JONKKKK#4186**: im not gonna play it. ever.
**JONKKKK#4186**: lol
**Zildin#0532**: what is this?
**GoldenPot8o#2294**: Then stop trying to ruin it for others
**JONKKKK#4186**: its just gonna be filled with our argument
**Zildin#0532**: how does it work tho
**JONKKKK#4186**: what
**GoldenPot8o#2294**: I mean thats what youre trying to do
**JONKKKK#4186**: it gets a message randomly sent from like yesterday when he made the command
**JONKKKK#4186**: no
**Zildin#0532**: ok
**GoldenPot8o#2294**: Yeah
**GoldenPot8o#2294**: It is
**Zildin#0532**: kinda is tbh
**JONKKKK#4186**: and anyway, if fortnite dies ill be nothing but happy
**JONKKKK#4186**: fortnite is just
**Zildin#0532**: yeah but then what will stop xavier from bugging you
**JONKKKK#4186**: its like roblox
**JONKKKK#4186**: but like mixed with dota
**GoldenPot8o#2294**: Youre trying to say meh I dont like the game so neither should you
**JONKKKK#4186**: its simultaniously filled with screaming 6 year olds and also 27 year old tryhards that play in their moms basement
**JONKKKK#4186**: im saying
**Zildin#0532**: JONKKKKToday at 9:58 AM
yeah prtty much your right
**JONKKKK#4186**: "the game itself is taboo so im not playing it"
**JONKKKK#4186**: also connor what
**Zildin#0532**: trying to resolve this argument. You dont like the game, nate does
**Zildin#0532**: why does it matter this much
**JONKKKK#4186**: you just made it worse
**JONKKKK#4186**: no you said
**JONKKKK#4186**: "jonathan likes fortnite"
**JONKKKK#4186**: which is wrong
**Zildin#0532**: no
**JONKKKK#4186**: because thats what nate thinos
**Zildin#0532**: Nate said "Youre trying to say meh I dont like the game so neither should you"
**Zildin#0532**: And I responded the way i did
**GoldenPot8o#2294**: Also Id like to point out a) someone else made me get it. B) I really got into it for the story
**JONKKKK#4186**: no im saying "the game is taboo so liking it is generally made fun of"
**Zildin#0532**: yeah
**JONKKKK#4186**: and what "story"
**Zildin#0532**: and nate still plays it
**GoldenPot8o#2294**: Well the cubey boi did an oof to the landscape and there are other Easter eggs and such
**JONKKKK#4186**: oh that "story"
**GoldenPot8o#2294**: Its just got a nice overarching series of events
**JONKKKK#4186**: no thats just content updates and changes to the map disguised a "story"
**GoldenPot8o#2294**: Ok
**GoldenPot8o#2294**: But that still makes it updated more often than other games you might consider good. Just saying a lot more happens in fortnite in a week than things happen in mc for like half a year
**JONKKKK#4186**: uhh updates dont make a game good
**GoldenPot8o#2294**: Yeah Im not saying they do
**JONKKKK#4186**: sploon has monthly updates that add new weapons, maps, subs, and specials
**GoldenPot8o#2294**: Listen
**JONKKKK#4186**: so is sploon better than mc?
**GoldenPot8o#2294**: Id say that you think so
**Zildin#0532**: for him no becuase he likes mc and not so much sploon
**JONKKKK#4186**: well its not better
**GoldenPot8o#2294**: You just cornered yourself
**JONKKKK#4186**: but its not worse
**JONKKKK#4186**: its *different*
**Zildin#0532**: jonk
**JONKKKK#4186**: you cant compare them
**JONKKKK#4186**: one isnt objectively better
**JONKKKK#4186**: i mean
**Zildin#0532**: nate likes fortnite. you dont. get over it
**JONKKKK#4186**: splatoon is better than fortnite
**GoldenPot8o#2294**: Yeah
**JONKKKK#4186**: i assume that was for connor not me
**JONKKKK#4186**: (that yeah)
**GoldenPot8o#2294**: Except those are different things too dumbass
**JONKKKK#4186**: except not really?
**Zildin#0532**: whats for me?
**GoldenPot8o#2294**: Except yeah
**GoldenPot8o#2294**: Like almost completely different
**Zildin#0532**: JONK NOT EVERYONE YOU KNOW LIKES THE SAME GAME GET THE FUCK OVER IT
**JONKKKK#4186**: ok jesus christ
**JONKKKK#4186**: fine
**JONKKKK#4186**: nate wins
**JONKKKK#4186**: im done
**GoldenPot8o#2294**: Finally
**Zildin#0532**: why was this argument a thing
**GoldenPot8o#2294**: Got dam
**Zildin#0532**: and dont be passive agressive
**Zildin#0532**: im not taking sides, im just trying to resolve the argument
**GoldenPot8o#2294**: Cause jonk changed my nickname to try to publicly shame me on the server
**Zildin#0532**: oh
**JONKKKK#4186**: and why would liking fortnite be bad?
**JONKKKK#4186**: if its a "good game"
**JONKKKK#4186**: then it should be fine to like it
**GoldenPot8o#2294**: I said try to
**Zildin#0532**: because people have different opinions
**GoldenPot8o#2294**: You were trying to shame me
**GoldenPot8o#2294**: I was not trying to shame me
**GoldenPot8o#2294**: So its different
**GoldenPot8o#2294**: You just compared shaming to a form of masochism
**GoldenPot8o#2294**: Anyways I thought it was satchel and Jonathan spoke up
**Zildin#0532**: ok
**GoldenPot8o#2294**: We debated and I won because jonathan ran out of arguments that were valid
**Zildin#0532**: eh whatever
**Zildin#0532**: im just glad its over
**GoldenPot8o#2294**: That is what happened
**Toaster#2600**: not trying to start another argument here but fortnite isnt bad as a game but since literally *the entire game* is based around other players and how you interact with them the game itself becomes cancerous because the playerbase is cancerous (and jonathan I can hear you saying "*ree csgo is like that too**" and I dont want to get into that debate but basically no you need to seese)
**Toaster#2600**: also thanks for filling up 300 lines of a text file with that u guys lol

**Zildin#0532**: oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooof
**Dark Elf#5199**: I don't know how to respond to this
**Toaster#2600**: Idk why but I feel like a survival server with factions and economy and stuff where we all have different factions and have like 'wars' and actual truces and stuff like that would be amazing but we dont really have enough people and also wed all lose interest really fast lol
**Toaster#2600**: but I think something like that would be cool
**Zildin#0532**: it would be
**Zildin#0532**: Im on a server similar to that but its a skyblock
**Toaster#2600**: ew
**Zildin#0532**: oof
**Zildin#0532**: ive been oofed
**Zildin#0532**: but yeah id play on a server like that
**Toaster#2600**: yeah but again
-not enough ppl for actually like good factions and stuff
-wed all lose interest xd
**Zildin#0532**: yeah lol
**Zildin#0532**: but we dont have to do factions
**Toaster#2600**: what
**Zildin#0532**: we dont have to do factions
**Zildin#0532**: itd be fun but like
**Zildin#0532**: we dont?
**Toaster#2600**: that still wouldnt change stuff
**Zildin#0532**: idk where im going with this
**Toaster#2600**: just like 'teams' where we have groups that fight or truce and theres economy and stuff
**Zildin#0532**: i mean its kinda hard to keep people from losing interest and stuff
**Toaster#2600**: yeah but in our friend group we do it like
**Toaster#2600**: especially fast lol
**Zildin#0532**: yeah
**Zildin#0532**: ~~especially jonk~~
**Toaster#2600**: we all go s U P E R I N T E N S E on something for like a week or a couple days and then we all just die
**Zildin#0532**: yeah lol

**Zildin#0532**: i mean we could bribe people with a reward for whoever sucks the least
**Toaster#2600**: lol except ppl rly only want m o n e y and i dont think anyone here wants to give away money
**Zildin#0532**: we could also just occasionally play minigames ~~except people on hypixel dont understand what skills are~~

**Toaster#2600**: nah
**Zildin#0532**: lol ok
**Toaster#2600**: id never really go on anyways
**Zildin#0532**: itd be tough but you may be able to create a survival server
**Toaster#2600**: making a survival server wouldnt be hard
**Zildin#0532**: with an economy and stuff?
**Toaster#2600**: no thats not hard its getting people to play and get a *used* economy and active players thats hard
**Toaster#2600**: i can just download like 2 plugins and have a fully functional economy
**Toaster#2600**: with selling and all that
**Zildin#0532**: o
**Zildin#0532**: but yeah we should just join some random server(s) and work together on shit

**JONKKKK#4186**: I would use that]
**Toaster#2600**: mk
**Toaster#2600**: and then the other thing (which u might noe like jonk lol) is that i thought of how we currently use reddit for ideas n stuff but we never rly get on that anymore, and u know how we coulda used google sheets but it was a pain? and also how i was trying to make a discord bot where we could all vote and stuff? Well since i now know how to use the google sheets module for python and also how to make discord bots in python i could probably make that work and we could actually say like "HELL FUCKING YES WE BETTER DO THIS LIKE RIGHT NOW" instead of just upvoting or downvoting
**JONKKKK#4186**: uhhhh yeah sure but dont you have hw?
**Toaster#2600**: yeah im doing it im just thinking aloud
**Toaster#2600**: getting o p i n i o n

**Zildin#0532**: >SG: Get off of TG
**Toaster#2600**: Mkay.
**Zildin#0532**: >SG+TG: Go through door
**Toaster#2600**: You do so. There is a small passageway in the wall, but it looks like it only fits TG.
**Zildin#0532**: >SG: See if you can crawl through it
**Toaster#2600**: You are physically incapable of crawling, you have no idea why. You only succeed in hitting your head on the wall.
**Zildin#0532**: >SG: Lay down and see if TG can push you
**Toaster#2600**: You are physically incapable of laying down too!
**Zildin#0532**: >SG: Flop
**Zildin#0532**: >TG: Push SG into the hole

**Zildin#0532**: >TG: go through hole
**Zildin#0532**: God damn it says im playing minecraft and Its not open
**Toaster#2600**: You step in, and a door closes behind you. A window then opens in the wall between you.
**Zildin#0532**: >SG: Get up
**Toaster#2600**: You get up, as TG looks through the window at you.
**GoldenPot8o#2294**: >SG: But TG can�t see through windows.
**Toaster#2600**: Yeah?
**Toaster#2600**: Who said he's looking through at you?

**Toaster#2600**: will be cont i accidentally pressed enter
**Toaster#2600**: but at first it was like a flag making contest where wed all make a flag and then theyd be judged and whoever won was like the new flag for all of boyscouts or something? but then it just never happened and the group of ppl went outside behind the stage and it was like a little store and I think they wanted us to pick out something for something idk what and (strange detail idk why i remember this) phillip bought a book about 9/11 but thats not important nate found a computer there and made this really weird intro kinda thing that was actually decent the logo was like a crow or raven or wtv except his wings had ice in them and idk how to explain it but it was like a good kinda intro thing except the program he used looked really fuckin bad (or maybe he was just bad xddd) but the final was rly good and then we went back or something and idk i think i woke up then but i feel like there was more i just dont remember
**Toaster#2600**: i mso tired help
**GoldenPot8o#2294**: Not gonna lie sounds like a court of honor, we get called up in groups to receive awards, adults show up without uniforms... and you lost it
**Toaster#2600**: no but it was like a theatre except the wall that the stage is like embedded into just didnt exist, only the stage part
**Toaster#2600**: congrats on making a cool logo and intro in my dream i guess lol
**Toaster#2600**: you did it im so proud of you
**WillCo Gaming#0258**: Can you draw it?
**Toaster#2600**: the theatre?
**Toaster#2600**: uh sure but it wont be good
**WillCo Gaming#0258**: If you remember the cool logo.
**Toaster#2600**: oh
**Toaster#2600**: again itll be really bad but sure
**GoldenPot8o#2294**: Just try drawing anything that was tough to explain
**WillCo Gaming#0258**: Yah, that does sound tricky.
**Toaster#2600**: fuck actually no i cant draw the logo it was a bird and it had its wings out which makes it like 10x harder for me to draw
**Toaster#2600**: ill draw the theatre tho
**GoldenPot8o#2294**: I had a dream where my coupon expired so they gave me 2 of a larger version of the same thing but my brain knows how much that thing weighs (or should weigh) so I kept feeling them to see if they were the right weight and they changed how much they weighed
**GoldenPot8o#2294**: Your brain is more likely to forget details closer to waking up
**WillCo Gaming#0258**: Sensible.
**GoldenPot8o#2294**: If your dream revolves around one thing then seeing something that is exact or closely related to the item then you are more likely to remember details of the dream
**Toaster#2600**: ok i made a really bad drawing and then realized i could probably just find a picture online so its T H I S except that back wall the stage is embedded in was just removed (the stage was still there) and it was really snowy outside the removed wall like it just led to outdoors
**Toaster#2600**: and also not all the cool lights and stuff
**Toaster#2600**: and m a y b e scale down the stage a bit
**GoldenPot8o#2294**: It sounds like an amphitheater
**Toaster#2600**: yeah but dont aphitheaters go all the way aroudn
**WillCo Gaming#0258**: No.
**WillCo Gaming#0258**: I don't think so.
**Toaster#2600**: ok no no yeah
**GoldenPot8o#2294**: What you�re describing sounds exactly like an amphitheater
**Toaster#2600**: This except there ARE walls around the seats
**Toaster#2600**: there were walls around the seats just not the stage
**GoldenPot8o#2294**: (Which is totally somewhere we would host a court of honor)
**Toaster#2600**: also the logo was kinda like this
**WillCo Gaming#0258**: Neat.
**Toaster#2600**: except the wings had ice in them idk
**Toaster#2600**: idk why i so vividly remembver phillip buying a book about 9/11
**Toaster#2600**: i made a joke about it  in my dream too

**Toaster#2600**: well if youre going for high tech then let the ai do whatever they want
**Toaster#2600**: if youre going for super safe do the last one and shut em down
**WillCo Gaming#0258**: I could always dismiss the issue.
**Toaster#2600**: and if you just dont wanna mess with stuff then dont do anything
**Toaster#2600**: well just do the middle one
**Toaster#2600**: its like the same thing since it doesnt really change anything
**WillCo Gaming#0258**: Except I don't like to deregulate companies.

**Alexr 360#7590**: Rip
**Alexr 360#7590**: Nice
**GoldenPot8o#2294**: so ive only seen trailers for ring of elusium but i think it would be really cool if there were no preset team things like when you jump in with friends, but instead you were allowed to team with anybody you find in game.
**Toaster#2600**: no idea what youre talking about
**GoldenPot8o#2294**: https://store.steampowered.com/app/755790/Ring_of_Elysium/
**Toaster#2600**: so you mean like
**Toaster#2600**: its FFA but in VC or wtv you can talk to ppl and team
**GoldenPot8o#2294**: yeah
**GoldenPot8o#2294**: cause like
**GoldenPot8o#2294**: only 4 people are allowed to win
**GoldenPot8o#2294**: so it would be cool if you could just team with whoever
**And Now For Something Different#9844**: I�m disappointed in Smith�s.
**And Now For Something Different#9844**: Out of everything and every single card they have, they didn�t have a Steam card.
**WillCo Gaming#0258**: OOof.
**WillCo Gaming#0258**: That's unusual.
**Toaster#2600**: ive seen steam cards at smiths
**Toaster#2600**: prolly just bought out lol
**WillCo Gaming#0258**: Normally.
**WillCo Gaming#0258**: Ya.
**WillCo Gaming#0258**: I actually had a good experience with Smith
**WillCo Gaming#0258**: s recently.
**GoldenPot8o#2294**: It�s nearing Christmas so it doesn�t surprise me
**And Now For Something Different#9844**: *It�s the most greediest time of the year-*
**WillCo Gaming#0258**: I had to buy a AAAA battery, and I didn't think Smith's would have any but they did!

**WillCo Gaming#0258**: Oof.
**Philio Io#6139**: Damn you must have been complaining hard
**GoldenPot8o#2294**: My parents are paying for your puny little paycheck so maybe i should get a little more respect because if I remember correctly one issue I had was teachers thinking that they are above the rules at school one of them being respect your peers and teachers so maybe be a little less �meeh I�m the teacher so I�m always right� and I know that she�s dodging me because she was gone the next day and every time she assigns a project like this she gets by on technicality like the time with the no homework weekend
