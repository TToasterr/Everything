# Single File Projects
## A bunch of random stuff i've made with Python.

---

### browse.py
Just me messing around with opening tabs with python scripts. Opens reddit.

### classTime.py
Just tells you what the time until my next class is.

### classTimeBetter.py
A better version of classTime.py (Automatically finds the time, (which may not work everywhere, I had some issues with it) and displays the time with a colon)

### rockPaperScissors.py
An inefficient rock paper scissors. Pretty much the first code I ever made in Python.

### encoder.py
A simplified version of the WW2 enigma machine.

### autoemail.py
An email autoresponder which isn't very efficient.

### autoemail2.py
An email autoresponder which is slightly more efficient.

### Quick side note: To use either of the autoemail files, when you run them, you have to do 'py autoemail2.py [email] [password]'

### datetimetest.py
Just me messing with datetime modules.
