# TToasterrr/Everything
### A Place I keep all (or most of) of my projects, for easy access.

---

**The projects are organized** by whether they take up multiple files or not. The easy to make programs are all in the *Folder Projects* folder, and the single file projects are all in the *Single File Projects* folder. Pretty obvious.

---

**The only other kind** of project is discord bots, which are all stored in *Discord Bots*. There are a couple of discord bots i've made, and all of the "Toaster" bots increase in functionality and efficiency as they go on.
